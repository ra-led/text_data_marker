Title	Review
Good	Really good but a bit laggy at times on the hole it’s a good game
Lag	"The game is good in general but it won’t stop lagging and it won’t let me play sometimes it .😭😭😭

Also it keeps opening the leave match screen when I don’t even press the button🤨😤"
NAMES	Can we at least change our name without signing into a new account
Lag	"Too
Much 
Lag"
Thanks real thanks😡😡😡😡😡	Thanks epic u just made me want to break my phone and sell my Xbox
Okay, so.....	It’s pretty fun for about 20  minutes but then you get bored, like don’t get me wrong I am on level 198 but still it needs some new things to make it more fun and interesting so I don’t get bored too quickly.
Jrjdjudjdjxjcj	Rjdjjfd
Separate mobile and switch	I think I speak for many mobile players can u plz separate mobile and switch players many switch players get easy wins
Fall damage	I personally think fall damage does too much
Why I like fortnite	I think it’s really fun to play if you don’t have a console or PC and I can play it any where and when I want👍👍👍👏👏👏😃
I want to play on iPhone 6	I have been playing on ps4 and pc since season 2 but my mom and dad just got me a phone I was so happy to download fortnite and it said it would not work I was really upset but I still play it it is a really fun game
Fortnite whyyyyyy	Dear fortnite I like your game but I am being hacked constantly so do something about I am getting harassed by your players I am only 10 and  I am being cursed at sooooo please respond soon
Bugs bugs bugs	This app is garbage, another could have been great app that was rushed out the door to make money before it was anywhere close to ready! Extra life, watch video, die instantly in the middle of your own territory. Cross an enemy line they don’t die etc. Waste of money. Consecutive day play bug. Of course. On and on. Developers clearly do not pay attention this and update at all, because I’ve read and confirmed these issues in hundred of reader boards and reddit’s. want my money back.
😁	Love this game in my opinion it’s the best game ever keep it up. (And plz can u make a no sweat gameode)
My review	I love it except there’s so many updates.
Commercials Too Long	Love the game but there are way too many commercials. I don’t mind a few but 30 seconds is way too long for each one!!!!
It’s great	The only thing is that Fortnite makes mobile hard
Why does it not support	Fortnite supports on other devices but they don’t support these devices if these devices were supported  it will have bad graphics and going to be laggy all the time and will keep on crashing please take fortnite off mobile for a bit and fix the game and then add it back when it is really good and stops crashing and has good graphics and stop being glitchy and laggy
Bad game for the first time voodoo:(	👎
Really good game🙂	I like the hoverboards. They are the best. The only thing that I don’t like is the infantry rifle. Its accuracy is just terrible. I like the game. KEEP up the good work and [ADD THE DRUM GUN BACK]
Plz add mics back In	I wanna talk to my mates but you took it out
Great game	I love this game much more than every other pay to win survival game. However, the energy meter when traveling seems to get a little annoying after only 3 trips. But nearly every other aspect of the game is great, I like the fact that I am  able to have a pet now (I used to just trap a wolf in a room and cal it my dog😂) 5 out of 5 stars because I know that this game will get even better the more time we give it.
I love this game	This game is just so much fun and I just hope they come out a lot more fun stuff and New Year’s and overpower weapons so I can just have a lot more for him and thank you for the lobby been so much easier
Crash and lag	Sometime when I play it start crashing or lag so hard it makes me so annoyed, but still great game
I love fortnite but.......	I can’t play on mobile it doesn’t work my ping is at 1000 constantly I can’t move most of the time sometimes I can’t even stay a game because my game crashes all the time, epic needs to fix these problems I can’t even fight people because I stop moving when I get near a single person, I can’t land in the bigger places because they don’t load for me, if they don’t fix this I’m going to stop playing because it’s making me very mad and I almost broke my phone because I was fighting some one I was about to kill them and then *poof* just stopped moving completely they NEED to fix mobiles problems
Best game ever	I love epic games
I love it	I have been playing this game since season 5 and I have loved it ever since
It takes sooooo long to get in.	I play fortnite a lot and I wanted to play on mobile. But when I download it it takes forever to load in. I started and there was at least 3 loading screens in a row and it’s just annoying
It’s trash	I don’t know why people still play this but it’s absolute trash I would give it one star if I could I’m going back to Minecraft a actually good game. I hope this game dies because that what this type of game deserves.
Glitches out	I only give a three because it is a fun and addictive game but it constantly glitches out.  Every time I get past 48% it takes everything away and I either have no base ground to connect to or I have a little dot.  It is frustrating as you spend a lot of time to get to 48%.  Hopefully they get this fixed
I love it	It is fun amusing and fun fun and there is some of my best friend s on there thank you epic gams and apple ok ok back to solos
PS4	Epic games congratulations you were the first game community that got me to buy and iPhone to try Fortnite I like it but I am going to buy a PS4
Used to be better	Fortnite was honestly the best in season 3 when there was rarely any hackers or sweats and had way better item shops and locations on the map now it is updating way too much and is going down hill every update.
My g 💩💩💩	Your game is 💩💩💩💩💩 get rid of new shotgun it’s trash
Won’t let you get 100%	I have gotten up to 80% of the map covered and then it will suddenly white out and everything I had covered is white and I get killed. I’ve done this 5 times. Also, why can’t you make it interactive with real players like slither.io?
Compatibility	Although I do enjoy this game on PS4, I want to play on my phone but it’s not compatible. Can you guys make it compatible for at least all versions of the iPhone 6?
Love hate relationship	The game is great but makes me pissed👿
iPhone 6s Plus problem.	I can’t play, it says you need 2gb and I have a lot of gb .
Lag	This is a good game but theirs lag and I was playing a game and then I was lagged off of Fortnite when I was playing good
Update	Can there be a trading update please
Uhhh	Why takes so long for the update to be released? I have to wait almost all day to update causing me to actually work at work.....
Idk and idc	Lalalalalalallalalaaalallalala pppl ya I lalalallalalalappl cheat lalalallalalalalalallaslall
Ok but some problems	It’s a good game, but after the new update my phone was laggy and it started crashing a lot of times and then it takes minutes for it to load again
Problems with your none-epic game, epic games.	"Duuuuuuuuuuuuude. Mobile players.. it’s so unfair for us! I’m trying to update fortnite and it just freezes at some points and says there is a error. Fix.it. 

MAKE IT FAIR TO MOBILE PLAYERS!!!!!!!
I used to love fortnite. Now, it’s just a PAIN•IN•THE•ASS
FIX•YOUR•GAME• and actually make it epic. Your name is epicgames and none of yours games are even epic.. make this one epic."
To Dad mom Tony Campo’s Scarlet Deas	I love fortnight but I am trying my hardest to get off but Epicgames is doing so much so I’m trying To get the battle pass my birthday 🎁😔😔😔😍👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Awful	Ok the quality is decent but there are so many glitches they need to fix it oh wait they are too lazy and busy making dumb and cringey ads for there other glitchy game .I can’t wait to delete this waste of storage which only exists to take up storage and drop trash wherever it goes.
Thank you	For your gift and your game
This game is the worst	This game needs to work with iPod touch because kids like me want to play fortnite too
Don’t Play This	I started playing Fortnite around the beginning of season four and i quit around a month ago because this game just keeps getting worse and worse, 95% of the time, you get lasered by a bot using auto fire, the weapons are unbalanced, the game runs horribly on even high end devices (I used to use an iPad Pro 2017) and worst of all, Epic Games doesn’t listen to the community, especially the mobile community, they need to understand that not all mobile players play just to pass time, there are hardcore mobile players and before I quit, I used to be one of them. Not only that, the game didn’t age well, games such as Minecraft got better over time, but a game like Fortnite gets worse with every update or season that comes out, I started to get bored around season 7, by that time, the game was just a chore to play, by season 8, the game had lost 80% of what used to make it great. By the time that the pump was vaulted, I had enough of this game and quit, and I am happy to say that Fortnite is garbage and I wouldn’t recommend it, definitely stick to any other game.
Fortnite	I used to be a defaulty boi but now I’m a one skinned wonder
Really great but I disagree with some	I really love the game but I don’t like  how when you shout them it takes forever
Could be better	Too many ads
Disappointed 17 year old	If I could give this a negative I would because i worked for 5 months on this game and got to level 9,458 i believe or probably higher than that but now when i tried to update the app now it will stay on too h8 games screen and eventually exit out the game it wasted my 5 months of work i couldn’t even make it to level 10,000 I'm very disappointed and this game yall need to fix this if yall want to keep y’ all customers because I'm not very pleased
Way to many ads	Every time I die an ad pops up when I start an ad but a good game it’s fun
Application	"I really like this app because you have to really enjoy but there is a problem 😭 there should be one for younger kids but I think it is amazing kids or adults have to beat there high score and they keep trying to beat it every single time 

👽😭🎉🍨😂😒😊😩😏👍😀😁😂🙃😍😗😋😜🧐🤩😒😟☹️😫😢🤯🥶😰🤗🤫😐🙄🙄😧😴🤢😷🤑👿🤡💀👾😻😺🙀👎🤲👏🏿🤛🏿✌🏿👌👆✋🖖🏼💪🏽🙏🏻💄🦷👃🏿👀👤👧🏻👩🏼👩🏼‍🦱👨🏻‍🦰👩🏻‍🦳👨🏻‍🦲🧓🏻👳🏼‍♀️👮🏼‍♀️👷🏼‍♂️🕵🏼‍♀️🕵🏼‍♀️👨🏼‍⚕️👩🏼‍🍳👨🏼‍🎓👩🏼‍🏫👨🏼‍🏭👩🏾‍💼👨🏼‍🔧👩🏽‍🎨👨🏻‍🚒👩🏻‍🚀"
Problems	Please fix this everytime I play Fortnite now it kicks me out of the game.
Stupid game	I Accidentally shot the trader and he won’t give my stuff back I hate this game I’ve had to delete the game 4 times because of that!
Trash	This game is literally garbage I threw my pc across the road
This game is awesome	This game is awesome and is hard to get wins that’s why I like it so much. I got 600 wins but I played it sense it released.
;-;	I love fortnite it’s awesome but... it’s tooooo laggy and there’s to many updates! I like it but there’s just toooooo many updates
Hexil jump	It’s a amazing app
Why Epic, I want answers	Why did you put the Nividia bundle in the shop I love fortnite so much but it just got me so upset since I am an owner before it hit the item shop. Can you please clarify or give the OG owners a reward. Thx
Paper.io 2	Good but a bit laggy.
Fortnite	I also like this game beacoyse it is fun on my ps4 I do not want you guys to run out of bussinis
Potential	Has high hopes
Online	Will you make it to where you can play with real people
Fortnite don’t work no more	I love this game so much I play on mobile and went I get in games the map or the area I land at everything is pixel so I have to wait a few minutes until it’s not pixel and people kill me because I can’t see the weapons and also when I’m in games it crashes. Please fix this it’s getting really annoying or I’ll sue you guys I’m serious my dad is a doctor and my mom is a lawyer
You should add a refresh button	Love the game so much! but it takes ages for locations to refresh, (around two days) but I just can’t wait that long because I love this game too much! so when you click on a location could you add a feature where you can instantly refresh for some in game currency? Hope it’s not too much to ask for.
Best game ever	I love the game I hope one day I can play with ninja
Use code Tfue	It’s a great game and the most fun
I pod	You need to bring fortnite to the I pod touch, but I still love fortnite
Amazing	It makes me feel amazing it’s so nice and soothing!!
Can we get some use out of the sofa or bed?	"Can our survivor take a nap and restore energy faster? 
Thanks! Love the game!"
Explanation	Good game but boring because the same thing always happen. Please add unvaulted squads back!!!
You guys have great taste but one thing you gotta do	Helix jump has inspired my kids to open up to there surroundings and because of you they get way more careful but all these adds now im not saying the adds are bad some of the adds make kids feel stressed out so you you can still have ads just don’t make it pop up almost every single minute please hope you understand
Frustrated	This game is quite addicting, however frustrating because as soon as I go into a bunker or am collecting supplies the game crashes!!!! Playing this morning it’s crashed on me 4 times already inside of a bunker ugggg!
Everything	I love
Data downloading	"Plz put less data for downloading and instead put that data in app download 

Cuse i have low speed connection and i have to wait like 3 hours with screen on to just download the data

If u fix this there is no problem at all"
Controller play	I think that epic games should add controller play. This will make the gameplay easier so more people can improve and enjoy the game a bit more.
Selfish	When my mom was about to purchase me the skin that I wanted when I checked to see if it was still there. epic games replaced it with a skin that costs 2.000 v bucks. and the other skin was a girl! Give me 10.000 v bucks or will rate 1 star. My scout is mama boy 747 and mama is spelled with a y.
Great!	This is a great game and I have been playing for 1 month now and the game is great!
Horrible	Right when I log in I see these HORRIBLE graphics and when I try to play with my brother on playground or creative it kicks me out!!!REEEEEEE!
Dear Fortnite	"Fortnite is a great game I play as a mobile player but I bought a Mocute 054 controller. And it says  on happychick emulator fortnite does not work on iOS11 and iOS12, please could you tell happychick to now play fortnite on iOS11 and iOS12.

Thank you"
Work for iPhone 6	I think it sad because fortnite works with new devices but not all iPhones I have a iPhone 6 so épico games pls allow all devices to play fortnite(iPhone 6)
Fart	Gay in you
Amazing Game!!!!!	I love it! All I have to say.best game ever
I love it	This game is  so fun get it play have fun have so much fun
Amazing	Great game
Great but downgraded sense season 4	I used to love this game but then came season 7 and epic just started running out of ideas definitely a great game but they have just started downgraded sense season 6 and if you start playing now it would be great but if you played season 4 they just kind of took the game down in so many levels
Revert	We need to bring back health per kill because I want to watch my favorite streamers and they are quitting competitive fortnite I think because of that :(
I don’t like it	The zombies
Poop	And
Great game	This game has really good quality and good graphics. I also love the way u can now play on controllers.😀😀
Fix it	When I press watch add to continue after the add it makes me start a new game. I still like your game just please fix it. I’m begging you I wanna play this game the right way.
I am the one that kills every one	So look i just want the orgs in the game also the eggs of the dragons shall hatch and i want foods like donuts and pizzas and all of these. Also i want epic games to hand me 5000000 dollars
Amazing game	I have played since season 5 and I always play with friends it is amazing
Fun but annoying	I love this game that’s why I gave 4 star rating, but the glitches need to be fixed. I’m trying to get a new skin and cover 50% of the map but it’s impossible with these problems, I was at 20% and no one was around me what so ever and I was killed, also when I was killed in a previous game I selected free life and when I came back I had no land area only me flying around the map and of course got killed when there was no safe place to go to. Great game but needs a lot of improvement!
Please fix this	This is one of the most fun games I have ever played and the fact that I can be on a phone and do as well as someone on a console is awesome BUT when I try to shoot an AR it lags like crazy and I have tried a lot of stuff like deleting some of my apps or powering off my phone and then powering and it will not help so I would be very grateful if someone at epic could do something about it. i would appreciate it so much. And the AR lag is making me hate the game and I would hate to stop playing especially since I have spent over 500 Dollars on skins and the battlepass. Thank you for reading my feedback god bless and hope you fix this bug yours truly A pre schooler
Love fortnite	"Memes i like:
Me:hi
Beef boss:take the L
Beef boss killed Me
Me:hello friend
Noob master 123:take the L
Me:oh its on
Me killed noob master 123
Me:take the L
Me:I'm a banana hey"
LAGGG	THIS GAME IS SOO GOOD!!! But it needs to stop lagging on my iPad and also when I play with my friends it lags allot so we only play a bit.
Great but...	I love fortnite, but I can’t play it mobile. I have an iPhone 6 but every time I download fortnite it says it only works for iPhones 6s and up. Can you please try to make it in the future where I can play fortnite on iPhone 6. Thank you.
Why	I did nothing but I am not always going to the game
Great work epic	Fortnite is a awesome
Fortnite	It is a awesome free to play game with so many things to do .
Ok game	YOUR GAME IS cool just TAKE THE ADS OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.😇
Hey	So I have a iPhone 6 and it does not work and I don’t know why I would like them to make it be able to work for iPhone 6
AAA+DDIICCTTIINNGG	I just can’t stop bouncin to the next bounceAbought !
One of the best games I have played	Been playing for almost 2 years I pretty good at the game
Best battle game royal game ever	You can kill people just like you can kill people in real life
I Can't Play Arena	So I Was Playing With My Friend ajsfrost08 Then He Is Stuck In The Loading Screen And Im In the spawn Island, When I Got into the battle bus I will Go Back To the Arena Loading Screen Fortnite is my favorite Game But That..... That Disappoints me Epic Games Please Fix That Please🙏
Could use a little improvement	The updates do not always load in plus for iOS devices there are specific downtimes at times and it just takes a long time. Overall really good game and but could use minimal work.
Helix jump one of the best games ever	I really really love this game and I have loved it since I downloaded it ... I think that anyone who plays this game will love it!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😆😁😆😁😁😆
So awesome	"I think this game is awesome I toys to have and now I think it’s 
Even awesome now"
The best game	It’s so cool because new thing get add in and more fun with my friends and me hope it stay good😱🙏
Interact	There is a bug on mobile when you want to interact or pick up a different item when using tap anywhere when I want to pick up a weapon it shoots instead swapping it I have to drop my item to change it
Best game ever	"Fortnite is the best game ever!!! And if anyone hates on it let them hate. But
Once they find out the truth they will feel silly."
Fortnite is so fun	I just can’t stop playing it’s so fun. I literally when I’m playing get hooked and I just can’t stop playing. When you turn the FPS high the graphics are the same as Xbox or ps4 so do that.
Awesome and addictive	This game is amazing but why are there so many ads aka annoying but overall awesome!
This game is soo gud!	Gucci gang
Se cierra el juego constantemente.	El juego se cierra en cada partida, lo que hace imposible poder jugar tranquilamente, además no se puede reingresar desde donde quedo el juego al cerrarse, tengo iPhone 7 por lo que debería funcionar correctamente.
HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME	It is so annoying to play got a few reasons 1st it’s all spam combat shotgun spam or the spam drum gun and you take away the pump 2ed is semi auto sniper A SPAM SNIPER COME ON 3th it always crashes when I do good.     Butttttt it annoyingly addicting
Fortnite	It is a very good game it is usually an enjoyable game to play I have fun with my friends when I play it screaming laughing and having some fun
Excellent game but..........	It always crashes!!! I was in a game with 17 eliminations and 3 people left and boom suddenly on the home screen, just in the last hour I’ve been playing it’s crashed 7-8 times like seriously Epic Games FIX THE CRASHING ON IPADS!!
Game won’t load	The game is stuck on the loading screen, I haven’t play in Months!!!!!!!! I feel so left out!!!!!!!!!!!! I have commented before to fix this with no outcome. I have gone too far in this game to restart. At least give me some kind of guidance to fix this problem without restarting.
Toooo pricey	Game, Great. Prices, Not so great.
Hex Jump	Cool Game!
Best game ever!	Sometimes there a lag but it is the best battle royal game
life changing experience	right lads, i can defo say playing this game has made me feel ways i didn’t know i could feel, inspired me to great extenents but most of all i’ve had intense pleasures from this masterpiece 3/10
To the creator of last day on earth	I really like the game but the thing that I don’t like is that when you die you lose all the stuff and the energy.I don’t like it because when you die you have to go back to where you died and get your stuff and if you don’t have enough energy and the timer runs out of the place you permanently lose you stuff especially if you have good weapons.:((
Helix jump	This game is great. I am so crazily addicted! The ads are annoying, and the game glitches a lot. Otherwise, this game is the best!
TTV.Fritz0330	Best game for a phone! Never ending land of fun since creative came to IOS THANK YOU.
Minecraft is better then fortnite	"I hate you if you play fortnite in stead of mincraft 

You see the concept of fortnite is quite old and the players are too good. In Minecraft all players are equal and you can actually learn and have fun. Fortnite is filled with glitches and nothing else but battle royals. In Minecraft you can play many other games and still play the original Minecraft."
So long	This new update takes sooo long it fucken pisses me of
Absolutely terrible	"It freezes and doesn’t let me 
And it freezes or Ariana taking away points all the time .also it needs an update but it dousnt work on mobile."
This game is doodoo	This game is soo doodoo that I can’t update my parch
Good but a lot of glitches	I like playing fortnie but it keeps kicking me out when I play a game a lot of bugs but grate game
Crashes	Why does your game crash every single minute I play the game. Mobile players crash before or soon as the hit the ground can you fix it.
No	U
Bad game	it is so bad
Helps me do chalanges on the go	This is great
I would give it 5 stars but...	The game kicked me out of the servers while I was playing and it really annoyed me because I was in the middle of a 7 kill game on solos and I was about to win when it kicked me out of the game and logged me out of my account. Never. Playing. Again
Make it playable on iPod	Come on everyone loves fortnite it’s awesome but doesn’t work on iPod a lot of people have iPods.
Paper is 2	It is a very fun game I love it I play it every time I have a chance
Best Game Ever	Fortnite is the best game ever but hear me out when Ninja reports stream sniping and gets killed by a normal player and he reports them for stream sniping and he has so many people banned for no reason he should not be able to do this
EPIC!	Epic.
I am so proud	I just made 103 kills and I am in fantasy land now this game is awesome but I wish there was a skin you could get when you killed 100 people. And I wish there were challenges like in Paper.io 1
Good	Good game nice
Fortnite is fabulous	Fortnite is fun and addicting
Horrible	The main point in this game is to murder others and destroy stuff.Thats just wrong.😾😾😾
iPhone 5s	I really want fortnite on the iPhone 5s epic games can fortnite be on the iPhone 5s thank you
Glitchy	It’s sooooooo much fun but it is kind of annoying that it is always glitching
Fort nite	Fun game download times are long but worth the wait
1 star only for fortnite on mobile	In mobile graphics hella trash glitchs every where 400 ping in PS4 1000000x better
Great game	This is a great game I see nothing wrong with it and I’m hoping u can enjoy it like I do.
It is good after all	I tried it at first and it was bad then I tried it more and fix the controls and I loved it!
The game is great, but...	The updates take way too long. Plus, the motion controls feel awful. You’re better off playing on switch, Xbox, and/or ps4. It just doesn’t feel right on a phone that’s the size of your palm.(6S by the way so this just may be my problem👍) The game itself is great though. Maybe in S8 we may be able to expand our controls. If not, please let us do in S9. Either way, the game is great, just play on another platform. Edit: I can’t even play the game now. When I try to join a game, it never starts. Until this is fixed, 1 star.
TO THE TERRIBLE MAKERS OF THIS GAME	It's a Good Game
Crashing	My two boys play so I down loaded on my phone too and really enjoy it but for the last few days it keeps crashing and the game closes I can sometimes play for about 5 minutes and the it goes again if not sorted I will have to delete it
Big chungus	Tbh the game isn’t bad it’s just people always have a higher advantage at killing me or other mobile players because it’s harder to build on a phone. Other than it being a little hard to build like 90s and stuff like that and the game just kicks me out sometimes or freezes, it’s my favorite game to play with my friends and cousins.
Cool Game!!!!	This game is amazing by shooting with guns by people and I like the update Today is sword fight
Hate it	🤬🤬😢😢🔥🔥💔
Hard on...	It’s a really good game but the only thing ITS HARD ON MOBILE!Im getting used to it but building In mobile is next level!Also when I’m (INSTALLING)an update it takes forever to achaully load
Fortnite Mobile	So fun with minor violence
Fix	Lags can’t do anything. Horrible controls, bad gameplay. Lags every time I try to do something. Even on low graphics and 20 FPS.
NOT WORKING	Tryna play on the phone but it’s not connecting to the epic servers
How great it is	This game is really good
New agent but I missed it	Noooooooo  Well I saw lachlen on YouTube it was AWESOME
Amazing game... but	"This game is a masterpiece, I play it everyday, and  Epic Games have done a lovely job. Theres a problem... Whenever I update the game it and load it in, It always says

Unable to connect to Epic Servers  

Please Try again later

Even though it worked before, but other than that, this game is amazing ! Nice job Epic!!

Edit: This game is unplayable now... please fix this problem because I cannot log onto Fortnite and I have to delete the game and reinstall the game and download it again.Then adjust my Screen, so please fix this...

Edit 2: The game just became boring for me, because you just do the same thing till you win, but what's the point, I still enjoy it still, but I'll be playing Minecraft and Roblox more often, sorry"
Tl55)lt5	No tno tú tartrestás trrr4rrrrrrrr4@te
Add Free Apparently Means Less Adds	So I paid the $2.99 to get rid of all the adds yet it is still giving me adds when I play.  How can you call it add free when you still force me to watch adds??
ads	ads ads ads ads ads ads ads ads ads ads ads
FIX YOUR GAME	You need to fix the lag and he glitches and when the sword is not hitting you, you are taking damage
Honestly Amazing	I Absolutely love this game on mobile, it’s just like the PS4 or PC version there’s absolutely no difference in game, although mobile is harder to get used to/learn.
So addicting	Couldn’t stop playing so much fun
Again. And again.	Here is the reason I deleted the game the first time, and the reason I’m going to delete the second time: I get over 50% of the map, and my land disappears. I was on my land, trolling around, and it was gone in a flash. Great game, I love it. But I want to scream right now. I battered back all those continuous assaults, was waiting for another person to enter my territory, and it was gone, all my hard gained land. 🤬 UPDATE: several months later-same issue, my land disappeared for no reason. Why does this continue to happen?
Enjoyable ... it could be better.	I do very much enjoy playing the game. It’s easy to jump in and play a few rounds and then leave to carry-on with other tasks. The recent changes, adding more green arrow downs and the coin is great. However, what can you buy with the coin if you already have the skins? What’s the intent of the spinning wheel to get coin with nothing in which to use them for. I have tens of thousands of coin. Yet nothing in which to use them on. The number of pop up ads is crazy. After you die or complete a level. I complete a level typically without dying so I see a lot of ads. Additionally, when I’ve watched an ad after I’ve died and regain my life again often times I fall straight into a dead zone. There should be some sort of delay when you get back from watching an ad or you should go to a circle ring with no dead zones as you do at the beginning of a level.
Hi	Best game to play
Lit	Best game ever but it’s dead now
Bad game	I wasted 1000 dollars and I get no ironic f### this game onestly and I can’t find no weapons and then die FIX THIS
How do you update Fortnite???	I have tried to update Fortnite and it doesn’t work 🤬🤬🤬
Make for more Phones	Hey this is such uh good game but you need to make it for more phones
Very good	It is so good I play it Avery time
😢	The only reason why I wouldn’t give this game a 5 stars is because I played this game so much that I was level 930 something then one day it stop working and till this day I doesn’t work 😢
Fortnite	This game is fun but the update is not working on mobile
They don't care.	"Addicting as it is, it's not a good game. Addictive shouldn't be the reason why a game gets five stars. Reasons why this game is crap.

1.) Repeating levels. There are 5-10 level designs that will continuously reapet each other. Low effort.

2.) Ads. They creator(s) of this game care for nothing more than ad revenue. You know you would make the same IF NOT MORE ad revenue if you at least cut the ads in half because players wouldn't quit and tell others to quit, too.

I am giving an EXTREMELY generous 2 stars. This game only deserves that one extra star because it'll occasionally give pleasure to get past a level when I'm bored.

Not to brag, heh heh, but I'm on level 170 and my high score is 600,000. Oh yes, and support to reason 1, for every single episode I've completed they've used the same 7, 8 level designs.

Do not recommend this game. Creator(s) have 0 care for consumers and 100% care to ad revenue. Game is trash."
Fortnite mobile is trashy ness trash	The mobile game is trashy trash and more trashed trashy when I press shoot you know what is does it doesn’t shoot the skins are very thicc and yeah. I like to have me fortnight good but it bad
F	Can you just Mack stitch free like the chopper parts
👌	Got’em!!!
fire	best game ever
AMAZING	It works just fine for me pretty fun game
Fortnite ipod	This game has to go on iPod
Lots of updates unlike pub g	So I love the fact this is addictive and fun but what makes it the best is the lots of awesome updates and new seasons again lots of updates love it can’t say it enough but one more thing to so much updates unlike pub g and that’s why pub g is not fun it would need more updates so that’s why Fortnite is the best.
:(	This was my favorite game, however I reached level 300 and the game completely crashed. Not sure if I delete it, because I for sure don’t want to start over.
Update update oh look an update. Omg	Headline says it all. Always updating it kinda gets old after awhile. Wish it can automatically update?
Yes yes I’m ready for Fortnite	Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Great but the stuff about it I’ll tell you	Fortnite is a great game but the lag is really bad sometimes and most of the time it kicks me of the app and has to reload and it’s really slow to load lastly,I play on Mobil and Xbox takes so Buick to load but Mobil takes so long I know epic games tries there best tho so thx it’s a great game make sure to be nice to everyone in the world and live a great life so thank you all for reading this I know it’s kindof Long FYI parents if your child is under the age  of 10 don’t let them play the game it’s pretty violent
Controller support	Can u guys pls make it compatible with controller pls it wold be really good you can put the people on mobile with a controller with ps4 and X box people that way it’s fair for the other one that don’t have one pls put Bluetooth controller support pls pls pls
I love it!	I’m in love with this game I’m one level 5698 I’m addicted to this game me and my friends play it non stop I love it
Was a good game	I don’t know what to say but this game isn’t what it used to be.
This game is 100%fun!	I got 1,297,103victorys!
The best battle royale	The game is so good every day something good coming and u could meet good people
Sooooooooo fun!!!	This game is great. It’s so addictive and the sounds of the ball makes🤩🤩
It’s broken	They don’t focus on fixing any problems in the game. All they do is add new useless stuff that makes the game less enjoyable. Ex. Planes Boom Boxes, Zombies. They don’t listen to the community what so ever. They are ruining this game.
Good Game. Just Options for IPad...	"It’s really a good game. It’s just that if you update it..it will take FOREVER to download and the waiting is very far apart.
The graphics too, all I can get is low, not medium or high. 
I hope you can fix this, I know a lot of people are having this problem and I hope you’re going to fix this Epic Games."
Wow!	"This game is the best game ever! You will have so much fun playing!
Kalina Estrada"
Amazing Game	I absolutely love this game. It’s one of my favorite games! The concept is fun and it never bores because it’s always different! I would highly recommend this game to anyone!!
Ko	Hello epic games am love fortnite place band thes pc and play stecehon am no cant killhm is srhaowd multiplayer am player moblie :-(
The best game	This game is the best game with the best graphics I had ever seen
Wooooow.	This is the best game ever.Because you can do fun stuff,and create anything you want,and also do challenges at maps
Here we go	So fortnite is an amazing game but they put a battle pass which costs 950 v-bucks. But I think they should do like what they did for season 8. A free battle pass
Best game	Every thing good
Should allow 6 and 6 plus playable	It’s not fair that the 6 and 6 plus are not playable epic should fix that
Laggy	Amazing game but it’s very laggy. Every few seconds my game will freeze and say “connection lost” then continue. I know for sure it’s not my WiFi because everything else is working perfectly fine, please fix this and I’ll give a better rating.
To many changes	THEY NEED TO LOSE THE SKATE BOARDS BALLERS ETC.AND TO MATCH YOU WITH THE ONES WHO ARE CLOSE TO YOUR SAME SKILLS YOU LOSE INTREST WHEN YOU GET SHOT BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST STEEP AND IT DOES NO GOOD TO ASK FOR THESE THINGS IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE GAME DONT TRY THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE
Nice	It’s such a good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Soooo good	I usually play everyday and there is no problems
Come on Fortnite!	You know that you are dying. You need to accept that fact.
I Hate You Fortnite	"WHY! Why would you ever vault the pump.
IM DISGUSTED"
Lag issue	Whenever im loading into a match the loading screen takes FOREVER and im at the end of the bus and i just sit there waiting for it to load and im already skyfalling halfway down the map also in the afternoon i cant really play cause the lag is real like i cant even tell whats going on cause theres so much lag
Bad	This game is trash
About the game	The gamer overall is great but now when I play it it just cuts out I lose everything. What in the world is going on?
Stop trying so hard	You’re guys game is really good I love and a lot of people at my school love it’s just that season 8 you guys were trying so hard and others seasons Ive been playing side season to but my favorite season was 4 and 5 and 3 until you tried so hard instead of having the classic game I’m not saying to delete all of the new update but like add the drum gun an tacticalSMG back but maybe take away some bad updates
Excellent	I have no problems at all with this game. It’s a family, friendly game everyone can play this
Hello	Can you guy add it for the ipod5 please
Ugggghhhhh!	This game is the most infuriating game ever, honestly, I’ve played about 50 games today, and it’s lagged me out before I’ve landed, every single time. Also the graphics are horrible. If your thinking about getting Fortnite, don’t wast your time on the mobile version, go play on pc or console.
Good game huge problem	This game is great I love it I’ve played from pretty much day one and in grinded up to a few mental rooms. But there’s one huge huge huge problem. I reset my phone bc of a virus but befor I triple checked all my games to make shere there saved to my account and to make shere the where saved and able to be restored but form point A to B something happened and my stuff was not there. It’s anoyyimg bc I had spent a good $40-$50 on the game. So all I ask for is a way to restore perches bc loosing my base is anoying but I’d rather have the stuff I bought at the very least. But as I said great game fun stuff new stuff at least 2 times a month. So I’m going to keep playing and get all my stuff back but try it u won’t be disappointed
Season 7, And The Infinity Blade.	I very distinctively noticed the infinity blade in the Sargent ice or whatever’s hand in the trailer. I’ve been with Epic since infinity Blade 1. I love the boss btw. Nice job. BUT, my real question is why was the infinity Blade featured in Fortnite? If your idea is to bring in some melee weapons, I agree with you, but I strongly suggest and recommend you stray away from bringing the Infinity Blade in. maybe as an LTM mode this might work, kind of like the thanos mode, but I highly suggest you keep away from the idea of having such a melee added into fortnite. (just to prove I played infinity blade, the damage of the infinity blade in the first game was 200.
It is the greatest app I ever played	This is the greatest app I ever played
Obnoxious ads	Cool game but the obnoxious, so not an understatement, is having me delete it. They have annoyed me to the point that handing over money to the developer to remove them isn’t even something I’d consider. If you want people to pay to remove ads, making them hate your product because of the insane amount of ads everywhere isn’t the way to do it. It’s a shame because the game itself is quite good. I’ve made a note not to download any other apps from this developer.
Don’t work	Plz make it work on iPhone 6 if possible. I like the game and want to play with my friends when I don’t have my console so please please make it work for iPhone 6. It is the same as iPhone 6s but with slightly less ram so I don’t see how you could not fix this so that iPhone 6 could use it
Game is good but..	The game is absolutely overhauled and they ruin famous dancing to only have 5 year olds dancing in the mall and be know as that “Fortnite dance”. Game is filled with 8 year olds who rage and scream and 12 year old perverts who watch streamers and fall in “love” at first sight. Never playing it.
Creative	"This mode says your island YOUR RULES your friends but when i TRY to put in a prefab it doesn't work

If you don't repair this i will sue you!!!!!"
Can you log me in my account	Can you log me in my account please because I’m just took me off my account so my name is mellow737
Gg	Gg
I love it but I hate this sign in	Don’t get me wrong I absolutely love the game but it won’t let me sign in to my Xbox live account I put in all my information but when I’m done and click the sign in button it brings me to a create a new account screen for epic games, not even asking me to create an account it just brings me to the screen it would if I clicked make a new account, I am very frustrated and I have bought many things on my Xbox live account and I’d rather not loose them. Please fix this.
best game ever	great game but try to make lag less
Omg	Y is this game so baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa🐑aaaaaaaaaad
Garbage	This game is laggy and to many people play it
Revert	REVERT REVERT REVERT REVERT REVERT REVERT REVERT REVERT REVERT REVERT
Soooooo bad this game is trash it doesn’t work.	TRASH THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD I DO NO KNOW WHY IT HAS GOOD REVIEWS!
Thank you are making a good game	Thank you
Too many ads	You die? Ad. You want to continue playing? Ad. Each ad is at least 30 seconds long. Too annoying to keep playing when you get on a role.
Over 12?!	This game is cool an all, but BLOODY HELL! THIS GAME IS 12+!! THE HECK?!
Never Loads	I used to have no problems, now I can never make it into a match. I just get stuck on the loading screen. :/
Too many updates	Updates the day after update. Then proceeds to update. Once again updates for another update . Then once that was all downloaded it updates. Too many updates!
I don’t like it	It lag to bad
Too many ads!	This game is a good game, but the ads and the bots are a little out of hand. Same with the challenges; like getting 100% of the map, that’s kinda 99.999% impossible. And the ads. It’s outrageous! I hate games with that many ads, but the gameplay covers it.
DOWNLOAD NOW!!!	Great game!No complaints.You should definitely get it. Sooo surprised it is a free game!!!
Fortnite updates at 11 fort mobile	Make puma better
Fortnite a great game but could be better	Everyday there is a new update and it tak s forever to load

CHANGE THIS	NEEDS TO SUPPORT ALL IPHONES
The game is good but..	I tried to fly with the plain, but It won’t let me so I used the boost and I didn’t work, please fix this.
Make Fortnite available on iPod touch	Please make Fortnite available on iPod touch. I have a gen 6. I honestly don’t get why it is so hard for you to do so. I am able to download it but I get a message saying it needs 2gb of memory. I have 3gb available but it still doesn’t work. I want to give it 5 stars but I can’t until you make it available on iPod touch.
Update problem	Epic it won’t let me update my fortnite on phone
Problem	I love this game and play it all the time but ever since i updated it this last time I haven’t been able to play. The ball drops through the locations and then stops and it won’t let me play
Very addicting	Love this game! Still don’t know if it’s AI, other players or a mix of them but is very simple and very fun!
Fix!	Beautiful game, just that the glitches need to be fixed..
Stop updating every week	Don’t get me wrong but I love playing Fortnite on my free time but I hate how it has to update and when it updates it takes so long then by the time isn’t done I’m busy so then I can’t play then I’ll go back to play and it will have to update again....... 🤦🏼‍♀️ I think it should update 1 time a month
Recent Update Fail:((	After recent update, the game won’t load past 28%. Don’t want to uninstall to lose the level that I achieved:( Is this an ongoing issue? #GOB
To this game	This game is just so much for it keeps me occupied when I am bored. Love this game ♥️♥️💗

Great game but	It’s a 5 game but there’s one problem the mobile players need a replay mode but it’s still a good game.

Can’t Jump	I can’t Jump on Fortnite Mobile
Rhara king Jahnyah jaylen Pooty love m j	I lo
Awesome game but...	I have been having this game for quite a while and it hasn’t gave me any problems whatsoever. But just recently I played it and the lag is terrible. I don’t know if it’s just my phone or the game, but it’s to the point where I will try to play and the game freezes for over 30 seconds and I have to restart the level. I have a feeling it’s not my phone considering no other app I have does this, but I could be wrong. Please fix!!!!
Crashing.	Since the newest update it logs me out the game every time I do a match . Very aggravating indeed that I just spent money on vbucks but can’t even use my new skins.
Why does it not support a lot of phones?	It is very annoying that it does not support the iPhone 6 you can even run PUBG on an iPhone 6 and PUBG has more graphics and things
Favorite Game!	I love this game and I’m addicted to it!Even tho I’m in just level 16 I love Helix Jump!From now on this is my favorite game!🥰🥰🥰🥰
H	Good
Yes	Help I I have no Haley jump no worries I’m here download in App Store today yes.
Ads	Way too many ads
Best game ever!	This game is so fun!
Thank you.	"I’ve been playing this game for several months, I enjoy playing very much. The graphics are just pleasant and the gameplay is fun and there’s things to work towards. I’m glad that you guys aren’t giving up on a great game.
With that being said I have one complaint, the 24hr horde is very ridiculous, there’s no way to build and save materials when you wake up and your whole house is destroyed. Sure, if you’re going to spend more money to advance? That’s fine, but it takes away from the fun.
I’m not saying take the horde away, but a longer delay would be more realistic.
Keep up the great work, I hope to see more changes and improvements."
I like it but...	I really enjoy this game but I have an issue with pine grove and pine woods... when I die in those two places my body disappears and I’m not able to get my stuff back. I’m not sure if that’s part of the game but it is really annoying for me since I usually carry rare loot with me!
Fortnite is the best	Everybody that plays it is the best peek Thames you for making this game!
Buggy	I can’t even play the game
No	I hate this game it is for 6 yr olds
Is I a rain ga,	I don’t like it that much but is still good I just hate how long it takes to do the update can you do something about it
Problem	"I’m stuck in a update and it’s a real problem 😕.
It keeps on saying, “A file interruption has acurred.”

Epic please read this"
Login expired or somewhere else where	I logged on and it said my login was expired or logged in somewhere else where “epic games” more like “epic fix ur games”
Awesome game	This game is awesome but glitchy I really liked it but very glitchy also I do way better on my phone than my ps4
Annoying	It takes too long to load from game to game. We die quickly and then we wait long to get back in the game. Shorten the loading time and let us play longer. I don’t like the storm either.
V bucks	I think the developers need to start us out with 500 v bucks than the more we kill and complete challenges we get rewarded with v bucks
IM OBSESSED	Very well developed and fun game to play! I love it!
Best game ever	Amazing
Problems	Fortnite is a great game! But updates are just... a rage quitter.  Today I was gonna play with a youtuber called Jelly, but it said I needed an update. I am mobile and I was so mad, I NEVER get to play with youtubers live because I am never abilable at the stream time. Please, make mobile get updates faster if you want to at least give mobile players a chance to be equal to computer and Xbox players. Minecraft did the same thing, and right now barely anybody at my school plays Fortnite, but Brawl Stars. Now, last but not least make the players who don’t have the battle pass get a bit more stuff, or at least a skin. I have no skin, but I am not a noobie or default. I hate being called that again and again and again. I deserve a skin after winning what would had been a solo. Please fix this. From Destructorkill77
FORTNITE	Make sure ur Quality and everything is okay but you need to fix your game a bit more better
The unknown box is trash	The game is all good and stuff but the unknown box gives yo the trash stuff can you like change that bra y u going to put all the good stuff in there but give you trash stuff like BRA
TRASH	This game is such a rip off and every time that there’s a new meta they take it out or nerf it and they always make it “even” but it’s not helping
Fun	It’s very fun and the videos and ads are exactly the same.
Bugs	To many bugs every time I get in a match I lag out and that is just not fun and it wastes my screen time
Helix jump	"Dear creators,

     This app you guys made is very fun. When I’m going on a trip, I use this app so I can keep myself entertained.

Thank You!!💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️"
best game ever	Epic I love this game and add a basketball skin
Fortnite	Fortnite is amazing
LOVE IT	Love this game
Brill	This game is amazing epic games really out did them selfs they are always adding new and wacky up dates really recommend
Fun but GLITCHY!	I thought that helix jump would be as clear as the helix jump in the ads but for a no internet game it is full of glitches when I’m close to finishing a level it glitches! So please work on that that then helix jump would be perfect
I’m sad	Hello fortnite :) :) :) so I had 5 dollars on my account And then I Didint mean to but I Acsidently Got the starter pack plz refund it for me next update :) My epic is RameyTheNoodle thanks a lot if you do
Great Game!🤩🤩🤩	This game is addictive and fun I really enjoy playing this game with friends and family. This game is fantastic I hope they make a Paper i.o. 3
Just because yes	It’s the worst game ever(Opposite Day)
It’s 💩	There is way to many adds and doesn’t make sense because you cant turn quick enough you need to make it better.*Periotttttt
Sweat	In season six or seven there was siphon and people would knock their enemy and kill them just for the shield and people do that today even without Siphon The reason why a one star review is to make Minecraft be better
I want to play on iPhone 6	Why can’t we play on iPhone 6
The best game ever	All guns are amazing even pistols
BAD	Pubg is BETTER
Update now ffs	HURY UP FFS
FIX IT	Seriously it’s a great game and all but mobile is so laggy and it keeps booting me out of the game. It’s the end of the season and I need more fortbytes but it just keeps kicking so PLEASE FIX IT NOW because right now it’s a bunch of ****
Best game evvverrrrrr	Fortnite is supper fun me and my friend play fortnite all the time!!
Crashes and I lose my progress	I play games and all of a sudden the screen turns black and I lose all of my progress on challenges it’s beyond ridiculous.
Mysteriously vanishing v bucks	Beware, this app manages to lose your v-bucks which is very Much needed to master the game. I have sent multiple emails to fix problems and although they admit to a problem, they never will return v-bucks....
Fortnite battle royale	I WANT V BUCKSSS
Adds	Is a fun game but I get more adds instead of actually playing the game. I really want to play but all it is are adds.
Great! For a minute	Its awesome to be able to take this game with you wherever you go!, but when it freezes every time you load a game back up I'm quick to put it down and forget about it, just stick to consoles
Make a controller for iPhone	It’s hard
Free Continue Problem	Whenever I get to like 28% land taken over and I die and use a free continue, I lose all the land I already took over and most of the time die instantly even though someone has not taken my land yet. Please fix. Thank.
Why game is great😁	This game is so fun to play🤪 and it will take your stress away😊.but it also makes you mad sometimes😕.
No	Not Minecraft
I hate it!!!!	Diiieee!!
My favorite game	5 star game I would get it
Fortnite	Best Battle Royal out there and VERY user friendly... Thank you epic games!
Awsome game but the crashes	"Hello ima big fan of fortnite I play on mobile every time I get on the battle bus it suddenly crashes it gets annoying can you plz fix that thank you 

Best game ever"
Very good game but	Honestly why did you have to put the age for 12+ when it could of been 4+ ok
I love fortnite	This is the best game ever
Rigged pukp no save the world merge stupid season 3	Uuuu
Amazing even tho I am trash	Amazing game I like season 8 so far I am on tier 100 I have been playing since season 2i play every day
Need improvement	I love the game but it lags alot i think the app it to big i have more than enough space but it lags real bad im on the iPhone 8 no way the game should be lagging this bad other than that its good
To slow i don’t like the connection on the gam fix it please	ASAP
I'm confused!	Everything is great buuut... whenever I turn on the app it has this thing that's well... it's a level but it does half of it by itself and it looks like all these different places! And when it does the half by itself the screen freezes! Nothing but the ball! It keeps bouncing! Can someone please tell me what's going on?
#1 game since Mario brothers	This game is up there with the best games in the world!!!
Please don’t bring back original skins	Please don’t bring back original skins please don’t bring back original skins
Money hungry	I started playing this game and you got rewards every time you leveled up and now it’s like you have to pay for everything and once your gone, your things are too. It’s hard to keep up with.
It’s good	I like it
Fortnite	It’s fun
It’s great but....	This is an awesome game... But, I wish you could bring it to iphone6 because I do play on pc but I can’t when on surtain occasions
Si	Fortnite pro
THIS GAME IS SO SATISFYING TO ME!🥰😘😍	I love this game so much I don't know what to say 🤓😎
Nice and suggestions	I like it but I wish there were challenges or levels just like the first one, or paper.io.
This game is my life	When I started playing fortnite I was shocked I this game was so good 👍🏾
Better off playing PUBG...	I’m going to preface this by saying that I think Fortnite is a good game for sure, if you’re playing on console or pc that is... This experience of Fortnite on mobile, if you can even call it an experience by the time you’re done lagging, is mediocre to say the least. The frames drop insanely every time you move which makes successfully aiming and shooting quite nearly impossible, the app just randomly crashes while you’re IN A GAME, and most of the features that console and pc players have are nonexistent on here. I know that in the newest update they introduced controller support and I was SO READY to possibly be able to enjoy the game, but no. If you’re an android user, congratulations, you may use any controller of your choice to play this game on mobile. iPhone IOS users aren’t so lucky. You’ll need a special MFi (made for iPhone) controller if you want the experience as well, which can cost anywhere from $45 to $120 for one that won’t break as soon as you unpack it... not worth it just to play a mobile game that barely runs properly in the first place. There’s not even a way to see your stats and wins on this app. They just don’t exist I guess? To sum it up, maybe you should just play PUBG mobile because from MY personal experience it’s so much better by a long shot, all the way down to movement controls, FPS, and gameplay experience.
The coolest game ever	I really liked the game because it was a puzzle game so it tricked my mind a little
Less ads	Less ads and if you can’t change them up ok
Fortnight	Omg best game ever 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Game is great in all but compatibility.....	I have a pc ps4 and others though my phone is a 6 only and it needs 6S and up. I do not like the fact i have to deal with that fact i cant play on mobile.
Fortnight problem	Ok so I love fortnight so much it’s a good game and amazing but the problem is that it should take like 4 mins of o load and it’s takes to long so they should shorten it but I hive it 5 stars
It got worse	"When it first got released for phone it was great but now it takes 3 minutes to load into a game

Edit:now it crashes non stop"
Fix the game	It lags to much when every i start the game
Can you add Thanos	Add thanos plz it will be the best game ever I will tell everyone
It’s good but some issues	It keeps crashing low textured buildings auto shoots randomly also auto walks me when I don’t have the auto walk on I got a new internet,new iPad but it doesn’t help please fix these bugs.
Great	My game keeps randomly crashing. I would delete and re-download but I forgot my password. Any idea what the issue is? I have the newest version.
always logs me out	it was fun at first, but recently just keeps logging me out when im playing. seriously needs to be fixed
Take me out	It’s a really good game and I like it but when I’m in a game it keeps taking me back to my home screen
Great game	I played it the first few days and loved it. Already on level 13256.
Is ok,but one problem	THE GREATEST GSME EVER but, the drum shotgun is broke I 1v1 someone and I keep glitching cuz of it please remove the gun for further notice thank you. Also my channel is Clash with Izak and I do 6 finger claw!
Add I phone 6	So laggy I can’t stop glitching season 9 terrible I hate this game and ps add to Iphone 6

UHHHH A GOOD GAME I LIKE	"THIS GAME IS DA BEST EVER I PLAY IT EVRY DAY BOIS DOWNLOAD IT AND YOU WILL HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE
you will also become broke because you will steal your moms credit card and buy all the vbucks in the world"
Remove switch players new or I’m leaving	Why who thought of this
Im amazed	Very good quality
SO ADDICTIVE	I would recommend this to anyone looking for one game.
It’s awesome	This is the best game ever made in the world if you are reading this than you have to play this game when I started it was the bomb I think it the best game ever
Why I like/Don’t like Helix jump	I gave it only four stars cause after I get a power up I can die.It seems like it should update and make it to where if you get a power up you should get a shield or something for like a few seconds
Ads	There are a lot of advertisements in this game which is very annoying but it is a fun game to play when you are trying to kill time.
Gun bucks	I love the Game but I just don’t like how you get a little bit of Money even if you have a High scoring Game and When you Lose they take 30Points Away from you we need more Money a Game
Best game ever	I started mid season seven but wanted to start at season one but I wasn’t aloud. I play on Xbox and phone and whenever there is a bug within 1 day it’s gone. Three words best storyline ever.
Trash	Would not recommend
Cheats you	Game glitches all the time and the creators don’t do anything to help you recover lost items. Customer support is terrible
Excellent	I love this game but there is 3 ads every 3 times you die.This is excellent for kids.
Update	Game needs an update. It’s fun and I love it but now that I’m on high levels it’s getting really glitchy... so glitchy that I can get through 80% of the slots then it glitches out and screws me up. Makes me not want to play the game but if you fix it I’ll continue! Hope no one else is having this problems
Annoying	"I payed to get rid of the ads because I enjoy the game.
However I’m sick of having to verify and except terms every time I open the app!😡"
Great! Account question	"May I ask is it Apple ID the only account we can use in this game?
Btw love this game played quite often a year ago."
Take in concentration	"I’ve played before on a friends phone it was really fun I played for a little then I tried to download it on my 5s I was disappointed when it said it wasn’t compatible but I was able to download it and deleted some stuff for it and found out it doesn’t work then I upgraded my phone to a 6 and I downloaded it first thing and I was so excited and then I seen the same message with my 6 and was disappointed also . Then I tried it with my Mac laptop and it was old and wasn’t able to be updated and I tried downloading it on it and it said nothing and it would not open and recently tried it again and found out it won’t work on my 0.11.02 I was close to being able to download it 

All I’m saying is can you make it available for older phones/laptops"
Playground kill count	It doesn’t let us we how many kills we have in playground
Review	I like the game but I have to keep deleting things on my phone every time there is a new update
Closes by itself	I really love this game but this app constantly closes almost every game I play and it’s very annoying I would love to know why it does this
Recent glitch 6•19•19	I love this app but... it started glitching like crazy and would move it itself and make me start over each time. When I would move it it would glitch and make me jump back and hit a color and say I had to start over! Please fix this!
Good but not good enough	I think it’s a good game but it is also not addictive or fun really and your not excited to play it
Decent game	Second chance didn’t work for me when I actually need it, but other than that it’s good
So much fun!!!! I love this game!!!! Make more games!!!!! I love it!!!!	Best game ever!!!
Ninja is a rapist and gay	Ninja tried to rape me in his stream by screaming and he is sexy
Best game ever	"Best game ever
It lets me play it’s my brothers thank you"
Love 💖	This is my fav game love you guys
Best game ever	I love this game so much been playing since season 4 and it will never get boring I wish all of you at epic the best and thank you for making this amazing game
Not suitable.	Look, I’ve always wanted to play fortnite with my friends, because that’s really the only game they play now a days. We used to play ROBLOX together, it was fun. But ever since fortnite came out, they wouldn’t play roblox anymore. I played with them once on my uncle’s PS4 and it was fun, but my uncle said that is the only time I can play with them. So, they always ask me “Do you wanna play fortnite today?”. I’m always saying I’m busy when I really just don’t have it. (Only my uncle) So, I told my mum and she said to download it on my phone. As I saw, it was on apple store! I was excited, but when it finished loading, it notified me that my IPhone 6S+ is not suitable. I guess it’s a fun game but I’ll never get to socialise with my friends online, or even play the game again. 😞😒😩😫😤😭😢😠😡
Cant play on iPhone very laggy and unfair	Its a really good game when playing on ps4 or any other devices but on iPhone 6plus you cant play as good and it is very laggy on iphones in my opinion i wish it would change so that everyone can play and it would be fair for everyone to play.
Grasias	El mejor juego......
Updates	The game is good itself. The problem is that it’s updates don’t let you update the game. The new update today about endgame won’t let me update. When I click update on the app and brings me to the App Store, it just says open and brings me back to the same screen to update. Please fix this bug
halp😂	so i’ve had this game for a bit and i was just past level 100, but now it won’t work. it stops at level 65 and i cant play at all or move anywhere it just stays on the loading screen and stops at 65. help? edit: i gave up and deleted and redone loaded the game in hopes that it would possibly save my data since i had game center logged in. it did not. i’m so pisseddd
Guns of boom	It’s very fun to play
Higher quality and frame work	That’s it better quality
Awesome game	I really enjoy play the game on fridays because I don’t have school. It is fun playing with friends and building things.but I loooooooove all of the dances!
Absolutely A Piece of Trash.	Absolutely the worst game I’ve ever played. Fortnite is a trash game.
Paper2	I love it
Not happy	Ever since the update it’s been crashing , everytime in the middle of the game . What’s up with that
Updates	Fortnite is an awesome game but for one thing it doesn’t update by itself. That would be amazing! When I play on mobile it just has to download every thing while I’m in the app! I just don’t understand why they don’t update and install while you’re offline!
It’s good	It’s potentially a good game but it is very laggy. Sometimes it’ll just freeze when I’m in a middle of a match which causes me to glitch out which is pretty annoying.
Love this game but...	I think this game needs to be able to play with friends only because I can’t play with my bff
Cool	Very awesome
Is good for me	For me there is no lag or freezing and I steam at the same time and it still doesn’t lag at all. (This was for me idk if your having problems with the app)
IT KICKS ME OUT WHEN STARTING A MATCH	Epic please fix this because the app kicks me out of the game multiple times
Addictive	I love this game and hope you make more of these types of games in the future also it’s very addicting
Crashed constantly	It used to be a fun alternative to playing this game on a console.  I can’t even play one full game without it crashing. Mobile app is trash now. Fix it!!!
Amazing you should totally get!	"This app is amazing and really fun to play ! I recommend and you can play whenever! This is really cool and I couldn’t find a reason to be rated lower than 4 stars. Although it is amazing, every time you refresh it, it will ask if you are fifteen or over, the age rating is terribly high and I know plenty of people under 7 playing this 
Thank you 😊"
An alright game	Fortnite is a very popular app so I decided to download it on mobile. The graphics are great but building is hard. Sometimes it lags or freezes.
Brick and ball	"It’s a fun game for my kids all though it takes their minds away from homework. But it’s keeps them 
going.I also think you guys who work should add levels. Thanks for this experience! From. Keri Longhorns+Marty Longhorns"
Love Fortnite but don’t really like the how to unblock	So about 2 months ago I got mad at my brother and blocked him from Fortnite and I can’t get him to be my friend again on Fortnite it won’t let me so I’m kinda upset about that but I still love Fortnite
Very Nice Game	I love playing fortnite mobile! it’s honestly amazing! the fact where you can play fortnite on the go is truly spectacular! but there is one small issue they need to fix. epic games if your reading this please fix the problem where whenever we get a notification the game freezes for like 2 seconds. that issues has costed me two wins. and also add stats to the game.
I heard a pop in my backyard...	I’m laying here in bed, on my boat, and the ring doorbell goes off.... so I closed the Fortnite app and heard a pop in my backyard but the doorbell faces the front yard... hey Bob can you go check my backyard...
Too many updates	There are too many updates happening at a time. Like I just updated mine yesterday, waited for it to load/authenticate, only to find that there was another update. AND THEY TAKE FOREVER. Is there any way you could fix this????
Communicate	Fortnite is not communicating well while the game is getting ruined this is one of the best games ever. Fortnite is not communicating and turning down the community which is ruining a perfect game
Hackers	There were hackers that made me get a score of 2,989, 11 away from 3,000!!! I am triggered!!!! These hackers are annoying. 😫🤬😡 GREAT GAME BTW.
Waste of time - and your life - UPDATE	"***Have you noticed the developers responses to complaints? “Of course the game is challenging” and that’s their response to almost every complaint! They have no problem stealing your money and attributing your losses to “challenges!” They have no issues of claiming you’ll find parts in dangerous zones but never tell you that you’ll never survive a dangerous zone and you’ll never get well equipped to survive unless you immediately leave... which gives you absolutely nothing. Pathetic!***

After getting to level 121 and not progressing in this game, I’ve decided to uninstall it. It’s a complete waste of time. 

This game will get you to a point where you’d think you’d advance to a “next” step. The developers then provide you the same old opportunities to “earn” weapons and special items. But, you won’t get any. 

All you’ll get is Beer, screws and wood. You’ll never get a weapon unless you go to a dangerous spot and, assuming you’ll survive, you never do, you get nothing! 

In other words, you can’t win. And the cycle continues... and you’ll waste your time, effort and life!"
Love it	I’ve played since season 4 and I love it
Gg	It is the most fun game I’ve ever experienced
Awesome game but A LOT of glitches	"Just think of bugs before you make stuff. If we’re working for epicgames I would try to make a weapon
What about a nurf gun of add a game mode for the zapatron.I miss the zapatron.Add back some pached/vaulted weapons back with doing a smaller amount of damage.If you see this note please make it true.
Also I get kicked out of the game at specific times. At any game mode except team rumble, it kicks me out of the game at 15 or 16 players left in the match. But for team rumble it kicks me out at either the 2nd storm eye of when my team or the other team reaches 1 between 100 kills. Please fix this bug. I’m getting frustrated. PPPLLLEEESZZEE!!!!!
Sry"
Fake reviews	All these reviews are fake… five year olds don’t use proper punctuation

Great game	This is a great game, I love it.
Kinda have bugs for mobile	I like fortnite but on my device it take so long to load into the game that the game starts.
Exits me out of game and takes forever to load	Lately ever since the new update the games are full of lag and it always exits me out of the game before I land... It also takes forever to load into the game😕
Really good game	This game is so addictive and cool that they added marshmallow
This game rules	GO FORTNITE WOOOOOOOO YEEEEEEE HAWWWWWW I LIEK POO
Vbuckss to noobs	You should give vbucks to every single player each season of Fortnite because we get bullied and made fun of.Let gifting come
It’s my life	I love everything about it, and I’m an adult
Lagg	"Dear epic games

I am starting to think that fortnite isn’t the best game that it used to be. The lag is terrible and when I’m on high structures I lagg off the building and fall to my death........"
EPIC GAMES IS ASOME	EPIC IS ASOME FOR THINKING OF THIS GAME
gay baby game	game for gay babies
Awesome some game but too much updates	All most every month their is an update it’s filling up my storage   So I deleted fortnight but I’m downloading it again this is a very fun game and could you just give some free skins and also some Vbucks but for noobs witch have no skin and could you not bring that much updates please
Good but ads	You have to have ads it’s how they make money stop complaining the work is a cold place
G	"Best game ever
Ufufufufufufufjfufuffudfu"
Disponibilidad	Me gustaría saber cuando estes maravilloso juego estará disponible en el Apple TV.
Lost $1000	I was logging in to my Fortnite account and lost everything so I recommend to not buy any skins but the game is good
V-bucks	Hey the games great on mobile but how do you change to a different card to buy v-bucks?
Good but...	They seem to just keep on adding more and more to the game that is getting really boring. I mostly just play for 1v1s on creative mode because the actual game is just really boring now.
Best game ever.	This is the best game I have ever played in my life I think I want y’all to add it to where everybody can play without having to have the radio tower
Fix it	I love the game don’t get me wrong but they need to fix how they disabled the mic for mobile users 😢
Fort nite unfairness	That’s not fair that certain people have to play it y’all need to get it together before I sew
Brilliant and nothing can change that	I love fornight and nothing can change that at all because it’s a great game thank you to everyone who plays this game and who made this game
Pee Glitch - breaks gameplay	"I often get stuck needing to pee and cannot do ANYTHING - can’t open crates, fight zombies, run, pee button doesn’t respond at home or elsewhere... Searched the forums and the only workaround is to die!? 
I have real money in this game because I love to play it. If I am going to loose those earnings because I can’t run away or fight, it’s not worth it. This isn’t just a minor bug, this is causing me to loose resources and progress (nearly cleared an entire red zone and my body was gone when I returned causing me to lose good weapons). 
Fix it and I will update review and turn this 1-star to a 5."
Read this	Fortnite is a great game and I love the building aspect of it but PLEASE GET RID OF AUTO FIRE I cannot tell you how many times I’m going against someone who has never played before and the game shoots for them I hate it and it makes the game so much more boring when I die to people who are bad
Play this gam Fortnite Battle Royale	This game is so awesome I can play it every day play this game trust me if you are not good at the beginning don’t worry I was bad at the beginning and now I am good play this game and rate it a 5 star.New things come to Fortnite the block gets updated.New skins come out play this game I am telling you.You can create your own land on creative mode.Its free that’s the best part.
Why	Addictive
Crashes like crazy	So when Fortnite first came to mobile in 2018 I got it and played it it was great then but now it crashes a lot and lags epic needs to fix this I have the 6s and I want to keep playing it but it needs to be fixed.
Fort nite	Can u please make fortnite available to iPad minis 2 3 Please
Good Concept... Horribly Buggy!	Great game concept.  Horribly coded.  If you buy no-ads, it will still want you to watch ads to continue a game.  Once you watch the ad, often it will have killed you off while watching the ad... Meaning you watched for no benefit!  This doesn't even cover issues where your land goes white, yet you are still alive.  Then there are the issues where it kills you off, and there is no reason.  Horrible, buggy implementation.   They've had plenty of time to fix it, they just don't care!
Good game	I like this game
Awesome game	I absolutely loved it!❤️👍😀👍👏!
Great because of change	Other games can be awesome, but I get bored of them quick. Fortnite constantly comes out with new updates and seasons to keep the game interesting.
Things just don’t work sometimes	So I recently found out about the crosshairs editing and I was really excited but it doesn’t even work ☹️😢. I would tap on the cross hairs editing button and it doesn’t even move the screen no matter were I move it. Epic PLEASE FIX THIS I need my speedy edits.
FIVE STAR GAME	"I love this game five stars to it it’s soooo much fun 
Love it"
Awesome!	I love this game with all of my heart but the updating is annoying that u have to update it twice for one update thx love this game so much!
Dove Cameroon	"Sooooo good! 

     -Dove Cameroon"
Hallo	Happy birthday!
Helix jump	This app is amazing✔️✔️✔️✔️✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
Can you please bring back the t-pose?	Tpose tpose tpose tpose please bring back the tpose because I want to but and my friend wants to buy it too
It’s great but	It’s a great game and all but fortnite is running out of ideas for the seasons that are coming the seasons like season 1,2,3,4,5 were great but then the game started running out of ideas I hope fortnite has a idea for the new seasons that will be coming.
Good but needs work	Fortnite is my favourite game but on mobile I dose not work it takes way to long to load and often crashes
No sleep because of this game	Didn’t go to sleep because I was up all night playing this Game
Helex jump lover	This game is a hit! it’s so fun to play when your bored!
I’m addicted.	This game is so good but the game keeps putting me against switch players. I love this competitive game though. I am addicted. (Remove burst smg and bring back the suppressed smg
Help	I love this game and it’s great, but it won’t update, I’ve tried everything but it just won’t and I can’t play it
Add it to iPhone 6	Can you add the game one iPhone 6? Pls I really want to play it pls
Crashing	The screen just goes blank on my iphoneX
It’s ok	Look l really enjoy this but....... it’s wasting my time. When it’s loading it takes 5 minutes and l think it should be quicker. But l really like it because it’s fun and it’s a really good game.
This is awesome	This game is so SATISFYING!!You have to get this. Though my friend played it and it got a little stressful for her, but if your like me you will LOVE this game!
What	This is a iPad mini 3 and it’s says when I get into the app. Yore I pad can’t run this app you need 2GB and I have 3GBs. 💔
WONDERFUL	This app is a great game to play! There are cheats too! Just go on YouTube and type “Paper.io 2 cheats” ITS AMAZING
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️	All the game does is lag out every time it’s in endgame
I can’t even get the game	They should make it possible for iPod touch
I still have ads after purchase	I love this game so I purchased the no ad and they still pop up?????
crashing on iphone	"i used to have no trouble w fortnite, but recently its been draining my battery like crazy, like ill plug it in and itll be charging but the percentage would go down. i tried turning my wifi and bluetooth off but it still drains and doesnt charge (but it says its charging) 
it also has been starting to glitch, freeze, and then crash. its been doing that for the past two days and ive never had this problem (i play on an iphone 8+) 
i also have a problem with the audio whenever i go to check the time (and my battery to see if it will ever charge), or ill click the home button, or ill go to turn my brightness up and then the audio will like switch to only one side of my phone instead of the top and bottom (idk how to explain it) so i have to end up restarting the whole app
other than that its good."
Worst game ever	I hate this game everyone is. Insulting me and they say that they will report me if I win 😢😭
Great, but needs improvements	Currently around lvl 80. The game is great just for an beta game. For those people saying “Missing resources” keep in mind. This game is still in beta/alpha. It’s no where near complete. Here’s some suggestions. Make a crossbow with an active skill mod that makes the arrow explode, add more snipers, add light machine guns, add a fully automatic shotgun (AA12 Ect.) At last. You should make it so we CAN get the atv Transmission right now but we just can’t complete the atv until it’s released because then we have more goals to complete to keep the game interesting. Anyways, that’s about it.
Add	This is a really good game, but what I don’t like is the adds every two times you die.
FORTNITE IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!	Me and my brother play all the time (I’m a girl) he plays on ps4 I play on mobile Fortnite keeps me active and happy sometimes I rage because he kills me a lot.thx for making this game epic games.
BANNED THE HACKERS	The hackers

Too glitchy	Every time I would try to revive myself I would watch the video and would still be eliminated. When I would spawn, about 90% of the time I spawned inside of another player and would die immediately...
Please	This will only tack a minute but please let any apple devise (every iPhone above the 6 and any iPads) please help me get this out.
The best game ever	This is the best game I ever had I love it so much
Fun for long time	Amazingly addictive
Lags	It’s fun but I’ll playing trying to turn and it will lag to the point where it will make me get and have to start all over
Great	It’s great period Fortnite got me into FaZe.Go look me up at FaZe Venom
updates	stop freaking making updates every day. if you want updates then make updates that make the game much much better
Paper.io	I really like Paper.io but it is really hard
Awesome	This game is soooooooooooooooo fun get it now
ADs	I was on audiomack and the ad for this app kept coming on and I couldn’t even push the X button because there wasn’t one and I closed the app went back to it and it kept happening now I can’t even use the app
Great game	This game is very addictive it’s slow bringing out new updates but it is still in beta and it dose make the updates more exciting. I do think they should have a daily log in reward other than that I would say it’s the best iPhone game out.
mupltiolayer	how i can play with my friend without level 27
To Fortnite	"Hey fortnite I have been playing your game sense season 2 and I was wondering if you could add some of the OG dances to the item shop like the floss,worm,ride the pony,orange justice,and hype. 
                               Bye 
                                     Twitch_FurilousB"
I don’t like it because	It takes away my family and they won’t play with me
Extra life is bs	I was at 55% when I lost. I watched an ad to get the extra life. It reset my percentage a couple seconds after I started playing again to 0% and I lost instantly even though I was on my property. This happens everytime I click for the extra life. Why offer an extra life if it never works? Atleast the original paper.io worked correctly.
HELP PLEASE!!	I used to love playing Fortnite but now I can’t because it just keeps crashing when I want to play
Best game in the world	I love this game much thank you for marking and I love you guys so peace!
Laggy	The game is fun and all but they always kick me out when I'm playing and the loading screen takes so long like seriously.
Like the game have a lot of fun but update is long	Hi=Bye
I love fortnite	Epic games you Gus have to fortnite better
Over it	Stop taking away team rumble. It’s the only thing I play every update you ruin it with some random new thing. Don’t fix what isn’t broken
Guns of Boom	It is very fun and gets addicting
SEASON 8 SAVED FORTNITE FROM DYING	so fortnite was dying by apex legends more players were join apex .L instead of fortnite but season 8 GOT FORTNITE BACK TO NUMBA #1 VICTORY ROYAL
Maybe something new	This game a very fun to play I’ve been here since season 1. But something that would be very interesting to see in the future is “save the world” added to this game. I know this game is only supposed to be battle royal but maybe seeing save the world in the future would be very cool.
Shahyan	You should let any phone play fornite because it’s not fair at all.
Really good	I have been playing this on my iPad Air 2 and the quality is really good
Wow fix the suppressed scar	The suppressed scar has no aim causing more deaths either remove it from the game or make the shots more accurate FIX IT
Give me my stuff back	When I logged on three of my items were removed why did the hell did that happened explain because I’m really mad give me a refund of my stuff:items lost ,Commando outfit,1200 vbucks put me minus 1600,and my hot and cold wrap,first broken cross hairs now this fix your f🤬🤬🤬🤬ing game
It doesn’t work for 6plus	Can u pls make it so that it works on 6plus pls otherwise really good game would be 5 if they made it available of 6+
Get on iPhone 6	Fortnite is a great game on mobile but please make Fortnite for iPhone 6 also
I love it 😊 but it needs improvement	"I NEVER write reviews EVER but I felt like I had to for this one ☝️...... first off this game is SO relaxing & satisfyingly awesome! The game it’s self is a great idea, but there are some drawbacks 😔.....

 No matter what  there are ads on the screen 📺 I mean unless you get tricked into buying the “no ads “ with helix premium. One other thing  I dislike bout this Game is that it glitches up!  I don’t know if this is just my phone but it’s SO annoying! 

Overall this is a great game but the ads and the glitches should be fixed....."
One problem	There is always adds. Adds here adds there. I love the game but to many adds. I get if they want some adds, but they should lower the amount of adds
Great game	It’s really cool I play it on my phone and Xbox better than pubg 😂😂😂
Quite addicting	It is a great gam and I recommend playing it
Best game ever! 💖	I'm 9 years old and I'm on level 181 this game is so fun I play it 24/7 💖💖💖💖💖
Butt	Its a piece of crap butt game. Every time I get in a fight it says input blocked and I die. I don't even have anything plugged into my phone or anything hooked up to my phone.
LET ME UPDATE	Fortnite is not letting me update I updated it twice but still nothing the proximity grenade launcher is here and the challenges are out so I’m annoyed I want to use the new gun and do my challenges
Really good except for the platforms	Up until about in February or something, this was a really fun app, but in an update around then, they combined the online game fill regions for this app with the fortnite on the Nintendo switch. This doesn’t really make sense, because people who play on the switch are like 5x as good as mobile players, and it hasn’t been very fun on mobile since then. I would give 5 stars if they made the fill platform for just mobile, or at least made an option to change that
Good game but major flaw	It is always updating
Fortnite	Best game on mobile hands down
This is the best	I really like this game
It’s not for mobile	Fortnite is a amazing game I really love playing it but the game is not for mobile the thing I don’t understand why let people play in their phone if it doesn’t work. I mean PUBG has published to the mobile and I never had any lags, glitches, and crashes. I believe they should work on how not to lag and other stuff  on phone, the game amazing but if it’s for mobile don’t put it on App Store or improve to play without any lags glitches or crashes.
Fortnite	Is the best game ever
Great Game, one huge bug	So I’ve had helix jump for a while now, I’m about on level 604, with a best of 2 million. I love the game, and the concept. But, earlier today I tried going into the game, and the intro got all wack. It skipped to level 54, then the ball was going down the tower but the numbers weren’t moving. It never got to my level, and stopped and 56. Then nothing showed up, no play button or anything. I’ve been having problems like this a few times since Voodoo made the new intro. I hope you fix this bug, because helix jump is a major time passer and is a very fun game to play when you don’t have WiFi. Thank you for understanding ❤️
Del juego	E sun buen juego
Its a fun game	I think it should’ve got free stuff for people
Best game ever	I love this game it is better than any kind of game it is one of my favorite and I wish that you have to complete some challenge and get the battle pass and also take care bye
Great game on the iPhone SE	Can u guys make all guns shoot at there accurate speed because they shoot a little slow thanks.
Replying to insurgenysoldier	They didn’t because they don’t give a f about the community.
THIS GAME IS LIKE MINECRAFT	UGHHH I’M A EIGHT YEAR WHO IS REALLY GOOD AT THE GAME BUT I HATE HOW MINECRAFT AND FORTNITE ARE THE SAME LIKE FOR REAL MINECRAFT IS THE BETTER VERSION OF FORTNITE OMG
Fortnite	"Currently beats every other battle royal game 
But there are some glitches"
Really?	It should support all apple devices, it makes me mad to see I can’t play it
Fix bug please	Game is so good and entertainig, it helps me to kill time. Just please, fix bugs, it keeps bugging even on iPhone X and ball moves slow while playing the middle of the level. Otherwise, it's really good.
This game	This game so good bruh I can’t stop playin it my dad took away my iPad cuz I was playin all day
Pork chop express	I have been playing this game since season 1 it is a really good game  but I think it has gone downhill but it is not bad.
Cool	Cool Game
Amazing game and controls	This game is awesome on mobile and Nintendo I love this game I have so many friends the controls are super easy and fun on the iPad and Nintendo if there’s always a new mode I’m in because this game is so cool though I wish you could collect v bucks without wasting money but I love this game whoever made the game you did a great job!😄😄😄
Paper.io 2	This is the best game ever💜 and it’s so addictive and I play everyday and cant stop playing once you start playing you can’t stop
Updates	They won’t show up
Error	After this update the game is not opening kindly do something
Fix bloom	Fix bloom please...
The best game ever Fortnite	Super fun to play and buy skins and daces you will not be disappointed
Love this game but.....	I love this game. I’m been playing it the past 2 weeks, but there is little problem about it and it is about the energy bar. It takes forever to get to at least 5. So can please put the time for 1 energy to like 1 minute or make the run use less energy but still I love this game.
Pretty good	I like the game, and sometimes slow
hard	Make it easier
Best game	This game is the best in my opinion but I think they should make it for iPhone 6 just because I really can’t play it on my phone
Very nice. But some flaws.	This game is wonderful and I have much fun playing it. I’m not exactly complaining about the ads, but it’s what happens during them. I was playing the game and my thumb went to the bottom of the screen where an ad was. It took me to another app ( which was safari ) without asking my permission. That didn’t upset me but when I came back to the game my thing kept moving and I died. I know no matter what you play it’s an AI I believe so I was upset when I found out it didn’t pause. Other than that flaw the game is amazing and I highly recommend downloading it.
adverts	I’ve seen the same advert for tiktok atleast 50 times in the last 5 minutes constantly without rest
<3	<3
This game is the best!!!!	I love this game you definitely should get it it keeps you on your feet if your going to die win get great tools get air planes all of that I really do like playing this and you should get it!😃
Best game ever	I love this game 247 I play this game it is so awesome I really recommend this game I would really try it
It’s slow	When I have internet the process of logging in to the game will start going back instead of forward
Let me play	Dear epic games, for some reason I can not sign in to fortnite. I am very mad😡😡😡. I need to play because fortnite is so addicting. My user is 101Kmac17137. Shank you👍👍👍
Great game but........	This game needs bug fixes because every time I play I loose because of all of the lagging. That makes me angry.😕☹️😞😔😣😖😫😩🥺😢😭😤😠😡🤬🤯😳🥵
Sector 7 trunk	Love this game but a bit confused as to why in the new update they decided for sector 7 to remove the trunk. Are you removing it to make it harder for everyone? I would think you’d leave it to help benefit the people playing. We only get that one backpack that doesn’t fit to much. So we either loose everything we worked so hard to get once the 3 days are over or we just pick and choose what we’d like to save. Can you answer my question please?
Fortnite	I love fortnite. I play on IPhone SE and Xbox One. But on iPhones it’s hard to aim and stuff
Trash just trash	Only small pp virgins play this
Just to hard	Why at the being everything hard comes even on the first level WHY just WHY
WHY IS IT NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IPHONE 5s	"I really enjoy the game but I can’t play because it’s not compatible with my fricken phone!!!!
I have to pay my sister to play on hers! How hard is it to make it for iPhone 5s! PLEASE UPDATE, PLEASE LISTEN!!! This is crap because of that! Please change in season 8!!!!"
Hate the frequent updates	Annoying updates every 3 or 4 days, tired of this sh*t
Make it for every phone and iPod and iPad	Great game but make it for every device
Tons of bugs	I bought the full version and love the game. But there are so many bugs! I’ll lose all of my land for no reason, or I will just die out of nowhere and not run into anyone or myself.
Some patches	I love the game I just have some patches needed to be made pleased fix update delay for mobiles
Good but bye bye battery	It is a super fun game with cool aspects, but kills my battery too quickly so i rarely play it 😔
Fornite for noobies	Get packing Noobs fornite on mobile is easy you can turn into a pro.My highest kills is 14 you can do it.So first time I got on it was kinda good.I left the game for life so when I got back everyone was so good.So if your bad you need train really hard to get high kills.
Yummmmmmmy game	Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum
Lag	Lag
One of my favs! But they need to go back to original!	This is one of my favorite games! You can play over and over, it’s easy, mindless and fun (which is what I look for in apps). Whatever they recently did to it though, stinks! Go back to the way it was! I have to watch a ball drop all my levels before I start? Dumb
I’ve been playing since season 5 and this is great soo far	It’s just the best game
Love The Game,But Also I Have Some Suggestions	I really love the game compared to the first version.This version is way more smoother and you can turn in any direction you want.I don’t like that there are SO MANY glitches in the game.I also don’t like that you can die so easily if you didn’t fill up your space that you’re creating, if you know what I mean.I mean there is a line which you move with.If there is another player going through your line you die.I don’t like that is that if you don’t touch your screen on which direction your going it will just move for you!Please fix all of those things that are in the game!
I love this game	I love Fortnite I love the graphics and everything my favorite skins are black knight red knight and merry marauder the cool thing is that I Have all of them I hope Fortnite is forever and I hope everybody enjoys it I hope the ones that don’t play Fortnite that they will cause it is a great game pls follow me on Instagram at thegoat14 and subscribe to my YouTube at thegamer10
This game dodo play apex	Toooooooo many updates yay dumb ppl
Amazing	I love this game and I’m a level 22 and only thing I need is the handlebar to the motorcycle
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST GAMES	THIS GAME MAKES ME LOSE AND THEN WHEN I TRY TO REVIVE AGAIN I CANT AND I GET SO ANGRY WHEN THESE BOTS KILL ME💔💔🙄🙄🙄🙄🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Fun but kinda bad	This game is fun and nice creative and this game has features and guns you can play with online players the thing is people’s mind is going to be focused on this addictive game people rage over the game when they die espesically like ninja,myth or others
Yeah, unacceptable.	A little tip for you all— All of VooDoo’s games have bots. Not real players. It’s a bit obvious now. It’s super dumb because there seems to be a lot of people playing their games, so what’s the point of having fake players? Seriously. There are also too many ads. Blegh.
iPhone 6	I can’t play but I love Fortnite, please make it to play on iPhone 6
CANT EVEN PLAY	Every game I go into my game crashes. Sometime I can play a game but after I leave to go to the lobby again the crashes again. PLEASE FIX THIS CRASHING THING. It crashes waaaay to much
Game crashes and I tried too hard	I have been on mobile for quite some time and I have always loved it. But, epic games definitely tried to hard. And when I get into a match before I even land it exits out of the app. It frustrates me so much and I am now deleting the app. I really wish that you would not have rushed it.
Fortnite honesty	People say this game is dying but really it’s grown more than ever it will always be a famous game I love this it makes me happy and so many more keep doing why your doing epic 😇
I LOVE THIS GAME but I would like more good weapons g	Hi, I have been playing fortnite since the very beginning. And since I have played the game a lot, I know this game very well. It is very addicting and I love it. But, I would love more guns and more creativity in the game. If you add more creativity into this game, this game would be perfect. I would bet my LIFE that this game will always keep improving. Thank you! 😎
Why is it not on the iPhone 5s	"I have a iPhone 5s and I really like fortnite, but I can’t play it on mobile, I’m not getting a new phone just for this game, so please could you support it for all the 5s users please,
Thank you"
Too many ads	Every two times I die it gives me a ad and is very iratating
Love the game, but hate the updates	I haven’t played in a while, but when I did, my screen would get stuck on the challenge map thing. I had to delete the app at level 5000 something. Not happy about that. I’ll give it a second chance and download the app again
Playing Since Early Release version, still pisses me off!	Enjoy playing and I have been at level 99 for almost a year.  One issue I have is when you clear the bunker or police station to the best of your abilities and let it reset, you barely get a tickets the second or third time around.  Also when in the world are we going to be able to get gunpowder and ash wood etc... there is still a lot of things we cannot build.  Last thing is if you are building an item and then change your mind you should be able to pull your materials off said item.
REVERT	REVERT
Skin	I love this game so much because some kids who don’t have a ps4 can just download the app and play with friends so yeah and also.A note is to please at least have only one free skin or like this update where people can create there own skins just like the ones in Minecraft.
Free skin	Free dance
Fortnite	It is very different from the ps4 but I still like it I like playing Fortnite
I love this game but I have problems	I love Fortnite a lot. It’s the best game I’ve ever played before. But there also a lot of problems too. Like for example, I always get kicked out randomly. Another example is that whenever I get on or I just finished an update, I get into a match and I don’t load so I have to get out and go back in the game and it’s really annoying. And also at random times when my WiFi didn’t is on still, it takes me to the title screen and I have to get out and get back in. It’s really frustrating. And also, when I report a hacker or a bug, the problem never gets solved. I also think for season 9, you should bring back the pump and we could have a different variety of shotguns. Thank you for reading this.
Fortnite	The best game
The game	I love this game. It is fun. Why did you have to disable the mobile voice chat mic? The building is better when you put it on high sensitivity. I love the game very much. Thank you for making a app!
minecraft	gave it a 1 star bc minecraft needs to be higher so i’m brining the score down. btw i came from tik tok :)
Copied pubg	Gshfjsncklkjk
Land Deleted Randomly	It keeps deleting all of my land when no one has taken my land over. Always happens when I get to about 45 percent cover. It has to stop or I will be deleting the app.
Ughhh	I love this game but I was on a really high level and now it's stuck in the opening page and says I'm on level 70 😭😭 Please fix!!!!!!
Fun	Fun
Needs improvement	I love Fortnite I play it almost everyday when I have free time but when I am on the go or can’t get on my Xbox and I am so close to completing a challenge with v-bucks as the reward so I can get the battle pass. There also needs to be a way to get old battle pass skins.
I’m kinda upset about this not really	It’s kinda annoying when you use crosshair editing and you click the tiles withheld ur finger and not ur crosshair is super annoying so could you guys please give us crosshair editors an option where you don’t click the tiles with your finger and use the crosshair editing, without you accidentally pushing the tiles on accident I get annoyed by this and die bc of this
No 60 FPS SUPPORTED ON IPHONE X	NO 60 FPS SUPPORTED ON IPHONE X EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A 60 HZ PANNEL.
Really fun and addictive but a lot of crashes.	It’s really fun to play and really addictive. I’ve been playing since the beginning of season 4. But recently I’ve been experiencing major crashes. I would be a minute into the game and then getting loot after landing and the game would just crash me to my home screen out of no where. Btw I’m playing on a IPad Pro. Please help with this.
Fix your glitches	Too many glitches they really need to fix it
iPad	I have a iPad mini and why does it not work! I am so mad you need to make this possible because right now it is impossible!!!
Let it be free!!!	Plzzz just make it free for players
Fun game	It’s a fun game and I like to play it but it would be nice to have color options because the colors for the levels are put frankly, terrible. Please more color options.
I’m Really About To Give It A Go	Ok, I caved.
Okay but	I LOVE Fortnite but it CRASHES!!!!!!!!! 😡😡😡
Fortnite	Best game I have ever played in a long time I would recommend this game
Kool	It’s kool
Ads?	I love the gameplay but i deleted it cause to many adds and not paying the money. Ill watch adds for revives but i need the x in the corner at other times. Ads will make you loose money if its to forced on player base. Also played 10 games with the same 10 people. Player base is gettin low . Me and my friend got on at same time and ended up in same game 9/10 times. Just hopfully you fix other bugs to.
Fortnite	Every time there is an update I have to wait till 12 or later waiting for your stupid game to say update in the App Store. I enjoy playing the game but when it comes to things like this I don’t enjoy it. I am a very good two finger mobile player but why do I die to stupid glitches and exploits that your game has not fixed. Also, mobile is a very good and fun platform to play on, mobile players are not very well treated like every other console. For example, we got our stats in season 7-8 while every other console got it wayyyyy earlier
Game crashing	My fortnite on my iPhone 7 keeps crashing. I play for like 5 minutes straight it takes me automatically to my home screen... sucks☹️
Auto-fire	The auto fire option is a really unintelligent decision for me, it takes away skill and makes the game overall bad, it literally take little to no skill to get a elimination, all you have to the is just aim your cross hairs on the enemy and that’s it! Just because it is mobile doesn’t mean you need to mess up the gameplay.
Dissapointement	I was expecting this to be on most devices but only a few please fix ur crap game epic
Me gusta le juego	Pero pueden poner una skin free para los noobs ???yo soy un noob y también si no estoy pidiendo mucho saquen del juego minigun
Mobile trash	"I think What Epic games have done for Fortnite mobile is trash the server crashing, game glitching on spawn and everything else. I think that if Epic games knew they couldn’t handle all of this on Fortnite mobile they should of never released it. Because no matter how many updates they produce they only fix bugs that have been there of a week or couple of days the bugs that have been there since Fortnite mobile and it just goes to show that Epic Games can’t remove these bugs and whenever I drop on spawn my character freezes and I can’t move and I’m taking about all devices. 
Epic Games please sort out these bugs"
Too much space	It’s a good game if you have one of the newer phones that also has a plenty of storage space. Each update take up at least 2-5 more gb which is very annoying.
Take so long	So I wanted to try fortnite so I down loaded it and it takes like 30min for it just too load so don’t get this app
Don’t know cuz I can’t play	What I don’t get is why the better versions of iPhone 6 but the normal one what is epic games doing making this game only for the rich and my dad pays more for owning a phone then would for buying one that lets you time travel
Sooo gud but	Hello I’m a player of this game and I resently got to lvl 100 but as soon as I got there I auto loged out and lost all my data if you can help plz contact! Ps English is not my first language
Wrenches and ridiculous stuff	I really enjoy playing this game but the drop rate on some items is ridiculous. Need wrenches for everything and they are impossible to find. You think if you can craft a gun you could easily craft a wrench?? And getting through Bunker Alpha, and the farm is insane. Savage Giants absolutely devastate you.
I love this game❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍	I love this  game it is really fun I want you guys to make a new game.
Outstanding game!	This is an outstanding game, impeccable I shall say, however I am very sad that fortnite does not support iPhone 5s because that is the phone I have, also I play on PS4, and I’m happy keep it up EPIC GAMES :D
Little bit laggy	So this game is great 👍🏽 but it has a lot of lags but I love this game it gets so addicting I’m addicted 🥳🤩🤪😚😋😜😎🤓😹😸😺😻
BEST GAME EVER but	"Ok so I play this game everyday and it’s awesome but this new update BROKE Fortnite it won’t update and I’m stuck on the finalizing initializing updated faze so I can’t play 
The 14 days of Christmas is out and I’ve already missed 2 
It’s winter break an my friends are Expecting me to play so please I want to continue with this game I’ve bought the BattlePass and it’s being wasted I love this game and I really don’t want to revert to     Creative Destruction or   PUBG 
Idk if it’s just my account but I need this bug/glitch to be patched 
Please Fix This From : Loyal Customer Who Doesn’t Want To Go For The Dark Side Of Battle Royal"
FORTNITE	FORTNITE IS AMAZING
It’s good but bring the pump back please	I’m begging you epic games
It takes a long time to update	There are a lot of glitches in the game but it’s a really nice game
💋💋💋💋💋	Best game
My skin?	"Hey I just bought the tomato head skin and I didn’t get it so can I please get it?

From,
InfiniteBacons 

To
EpicGames.inc"
Great game	This is a great game it is sometimes addictive but it is great this is a game about a 3rd person shooter battle last one standing gets a,”Victory Royale.” There are different game modes and events. Best of all you can play with your friends!
Fun Game	Oof I haven’t won but hope to in my future.
Please nerf	Ok I am getting quite annoyed by the smgs can you guys nerf them please before this game starts to die...
Too glitchy and way too many ads	Simple and addictive game but really too many bugs and incredibly long and tedious ads. Too bad.
I love fortnite but the graphics are bad	The graphics are so bad I wanted to download it on Mobile to play on the go but it is always lagging and the graphics aren't so good so I'm just gonna stick to PlayStation fortnite 😢
Best game ever	ILOVE IT
So fun!!	So fun been stuck on it for so long. It’s challenging but so fun. Recommend downloading if bored and have time!!
This game is trash	I don’t care about what y’all think this game used to be good but now that they brought back the drum gun this game is starting be disliked by more and more people and apex and Minecraft are two of the funnest games to play right now
RemoveTheAds.	"Omg like mostly every time I die on Helix Jump it shows an AD!! Please remove the ads! Without that, it’s a fanstastic game. Really fun to play. I would highly recommend this game for users who like to watch ads. Please remove the ads. That would make me so happy. Thanks! 

<^> Captain•"
Trash	Broken badddddddd
You are great	You are awesome
Tickets back	Hi epic games I used my tickets and also you might have one not too long ago my friends never get tickets back because its been so long since we got any of our tickets so they are asking for tickets back
This game trash now	Fortnite was good but apex took over you Need to stop adding new things trashcan I have been playing nba2k19 because Fortnite is boring
1/10	Took all my v bucks away
IDEAS 💡	Okay, so this game is really fun, and I enjoy it a lot. But for the double down green arrow that speeds you down, you should make a double red arrow that bounces you back up. I think that would make the game more interesting. Or if you could compete with players to see who could go down a certain level the fastest. Or, instead of competing, just do a timer, and try to get your best score, and maybe do that with normal levels. I know that the difficulty of the levels get harder as you go on, but so should you ability with the game.
The best game in history	This is the best game I’ve ever played in my whole intire life this is a 5 star rating for this game and that’s why it’s the best game in history 🤗😊
I love it	One of the best games but maybe you could fix some lag thats all
Apple is making this game Awful.	They have for months know delayed the putting out of updates. It is a reoccurring problem and a thorn in the side of IOS gameplay for fortnite. Apple seems to have no problem with PUBG or any other game. I don’t know what has occurred but I wish Apple would think about its consumers.
iPhone 6	Is there any way that they could make it work for a regular iPhone 6 💔
Fortnite	I love fortnite but the down side is that you can’t download it one iPad mini 2 or 3
Best Survival Game	Best iOS survival game overall, I have tried so many never liked any but found this
Awesome	Good game but it would be awesome if you can buy v-bucks for 5 dollars
Battle pass	I love it! Also I don’t like how on mobile you can’t update the game it keeps on saying open not update pls help. Mobile players are desperate to  check out the update. IT IS NOT FAIR! Sort it out
LAZY!!	Whenever I fail I click second try. 5 try's later. SECOND TRY WHY!!!??? the coders are just lazy!! And there are too many adds, but otherwise the games fine just low key.
Best game in history	This game is so addictive and I play it all the time with my friends in squads or dous and it is soo much fun thx epic games to make the game so awesome.
TOO MANY ADS	This game can be pretty therapeutic; however, there are too many ads! They pop up between about every two games, or so. If there were any (pop up) ads, I’d enjoy this game much more.
It’s the best	It’s
Logging me out	Fortnight was logging me out every time I try to get on it I was playing with my cousin and it kept locking me out every time I was playing in game that’s why I gave fortnight a three star review.
Thing that u need to fix	I love Fortnite but the thing is when sometimes I play and try to get my shotgun out it never works so i end up dying so u guys need to fix that on mobile and sometimes when I shoot at someone that’s standing still it doesn’t take any health away from them and I die by them and I have good aiming so u guys just need to fix that and the game would be so much more awesome.
AMAZING GAME ❤️❤️❤️	"This game is a very good game bc they give  everyone chances to get skins for a lower price and have all kinds of limited time offers. Not only that but the games are amazing they have solo mode,duos,squads,arena,arena duos,creative, and floor is lava. 
Something else I love about this game is that if u want to help a friend out u can gift them v-bucks or skins. And u meet tons of really cool ppl TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME"
Fortnite updates	Good game overall, however it seems like it updates every 3 days.
Ads	Waaayyyyyyy too many ads. It ruins the experience of the game
Lag	Fortnite is the most trashes game in the world I start lagging when I have 51 ms but I don’t lag when I have 56 ms why do I lag when I have lower it’s so dumb plz do not play this game then the hog opps came out I’m about to buy it then it glitch and switched to the wrong skin and brought it buy it self I got so mad this game is really bad
Bad	Do not be fooled and their ads are terrible
Lagging	This game when I play it lags and I do not like that ..... sincerely Aaron
It’s ok	Somebody takes your map and your loot👎👎👎🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡
MJ	Now everyone that plays Fortnite is enjoying it including me the events are awesome my favorite event is the polar peak monster keep up
I love it	It’s really good keep up the updates
Incredible	Awesome game I have 30 victories
Im Loosing My Patience	For 2 weeks now this game been glitching, freezing, and lagging. If you don’t fix it I’m deleting it.
Was good, how laggy af	"When I first downloaded the game, I had great fun, it’s a simple but enjoyable game. Recently however the lag has become so bad it has effected the gameplay. You can no longer react properly due to the choppy nature, there is nothing “smooth” about this. 
I have tried on multiple connections, in multiple locations (including different countries), it makes no different. Ultimately it is a shame."
Apex legends is trash you are wining Fortnite	Apex legends is trash
I love it	This game is so fun
This game is the best	I really enjoy playing with my friends and  it’s a good game to play in your free time try not to stay frozen to the game all good
Your game is trash	You didn’t fix the controls on iPhone XR that means I gonna terminate you guys if you don’t fix the issues
I love it 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎	I am getting better at forntie mobile I can build better add me Pizza Boy09
Review	Make so people can play on iPod because I always have wanted to play fortnite on mobile or on the go!!
Mack	Mack fortnite available for iPhone 6
I forgot something.	I’ve written a review before but what I forgot to say is that I think there should be unlimited storage for creative but other than that great game! Check out my other review for this game if you can find it.
Why is this happening	First off I want to say that this has not happened before but when the update came it made it to when you try to get in any vehicle it will crash and freeze up the screen. Can you please look into this and fix it by the next update. Thanks
Fortnite	OK I love fortnight and all but I have one problem why do Vbox cost so much. I mean It’s a good game and all. And why don’t the battle pass for season nine come free when you completed all of the Overtime challenges?
Its a good game.	Gets boring after a while no offense I still like the game
Fortnite	I don’t like the ice zombie that come out the not fun
4	It’s a madness
This game is amazing!!!!!	I have played so much paper.io 1, and I learned about Paper.io 2, I just bought it. If you do not know my player name it is Ducky, I have gotten 100% and most of the skins. But about the game. It is a fun online game where you are a square or other thing, depending on your skin. But you move around getting coverage by going out side of your coverage and go around the spot you want to cover and go to your coverage and you have that space. But you can die if another player hits your marks on the map you die🤕! But you can do it to other players also. You can unlock other skins and change it.
Game modes	The 50v50 mide where its 2 large teams pitted against each other was one of the most fun modes you guys have had...now that mode was only limited time. I started an instagram page if JUST THAT mode and have over 100,000  people that had commented about that mode staying on fortnite. It was ine of the most popular modes and we really want it to stay
MoneyMasta360.2	It’s goooooooooodu
Not updating	Its not downloading I have iPad Air 2, so why WHY EPIC U IDIOT TIM
I pad mini123and4 to play fort nite	"I really wanna play but have iPad mini 2 

I want that to change"
Pls answer I can’t update	The new update isn’t working it won’t let me download fortnite
Good game	Kinda of to hard to control I guess when I try shooting it barely shoots but when I’m running or sneaking up on ppl I shoot on accident
Its very addictive and great aannnnndd fun	I absolutely love the game
Good but difficult	WAAYY TOO MANY UPDATES TAKES FOREVER
Good game but...	Season 8 was a huge disappointment this is just my opinion hope season 9 is beter(~_~)
Crashing	After the update on my iPad the game kicks me out.
Needs a bug fix	When I in to the game it stops at 66 and won’t let me play when I’m on level 1176
WOOOOOOOOW	BRILLIANT GAME but IT’S MAGNIFICENT WELL DONE EPIC GAMES congratulations
Bring back the pump ☹️	I really love this game best game every but i and I’m pretty sure others want this bring the pump back and the SMG and take out the new burst SMG
Not good	I was on level 1,300 and sense the new update I can’t play it has me stuck on level 53 and I can’t do anything from there
Epic can you please put iPhone 6	To epic games can you please put fortnite on iPhone 6
I accdently signed out on mobile for Xbox	Ok at 9:34 I was playing Fortnite and i when I died I meant to hit leave match but I accidentally clicked log out and it did and now when i click on the Xbox it says Epic games isn’t responding please try again later so can you guys please fix this I really appreciate it and thx if you do fix it
Love of my life	Why this game is so addictive and amazing??? I have freaking spend more than 200 bucks and every time I feel I need to spend more!
Hehfh	Bdhch
Best game	This game really is awesome and it’s so fun i can’t stop playing it because it is so fun
Hi	It the best Game EVER
Amazing app just a little something	First of all I love the game I have been playing since I was 4 years old but however the app has to many adds I always get so excited to play and then an add of an app I already have. Other then that it’s an amazing game
Okay review	It’s okay a few glitches but alright
Fortnite	It was a good game but not anymore they are adding weapons and items people don’t want and are taking away the good items. Plus all the scrims have ruined the point of the video game. Basically Everyone who plays Fortnite is a sweat and try’s to hard and just makes the game not fun and boring. I stopped playing fortnite because of that
Decent	Not bad, not bad at all but I think Fortnite should let players change the little aim thing in the middle and change into a color, a brighter one. Because with something that makes out shots worst, it would just mean that we’re doomed.
To download this app take too much space and data but I like the game	.....
Regis	Shshbs amazing
Age group	Why can’t it be for 10 year olders
AWESOME but some Changes are needed for mobile	Please IMPROVE the graphics for iPad
Trash	This game is hard to build on and it needs to not be on WiFi
Kayla	Can y’all please let IPhone 6 people play
Bad graphics	The graphics are horrible but the game is amazing
Ads	TOO MANY ADS
Game is great but.....	Game is good but I wish there was a way to get more than 3 refunds. I have  accidentally bought more than you imagine and it’s annoying. I wish that everyone can have 3 refunds a season
Please read!	Change it back to we’re it’s no ps4 and Xbox :( I hate it they always are making fun of us and being toxic change it back it hurts they make fun of me cause I am half deaf and MAKE fun of Xbox Please :(
Wow	Honestly, I’m going to keep it short. Game is great. I have PC, but mobile is what I “play” on. After the last update (before 7.4.0, which has yet to be released), I have experienced major lag and then, the app would crash. It has happened five times JUST today. Please fix this in 7.4.0. Thank you!
Really good	This game is one of the best games I’ve ever played
Glitches and false advertising.	If you pay to remove ads, you still get ads. They’re stealing money from you via in app purchase. This game is single player only not multiplayer in any way. Game is playable but you sometimes randomly loose all your property for no reason. Okay as a free game but don’t give them any money. If you go into airplane mode you won’t see any ads and can still play the game.
Ok	I love helix jump but my game started glitching out with the new open app cutscene where the ball is falling to your level it won’t go to my level it goes to fifty one and I am at  two hundred sixty one
Fortnite is bad	Complete trash
Thankyou	It is the best game ever
Fortnite	Best game ever btw
Trash	Go play Minecraft
I like this game	I like this game but it gets really stressful sometimes by PStar7
fuvk me	Oh Yeah Yeah YeH 63@( Yeah Yeah
Good but a few issues.	I absolutely love this game, and it is very fun. It’s super addicting and I’m so glad I am honored to play it, but there are a couple issues. First of all my screen happens to lag right when I am about to fall on the wrong color. I’ve checked and my WiFi is working perfectly fine. Also there are quite a few adds, and I’ve realized on little games like this that there are always a lot of adds, but I know that this game is better than those little games, so if there could be just a little less adds it would be perfect. I’ve seen a couple other reviews about the laggy ness and adds; obviously it is a problem to most people, so I’d recommend to cut down the adds a little bit and also see if you can do anything about the laggy ness. This game is almost perfect, but for those two mi er issues I had to give it four stars instead of five. Keep up the great work!!
Sad	I can’t play on my iPhone 6 I don’t have the s
Best game	Awesomely awesome
Thanks	"Hi EpicGames Fortnite is a good game I like to play it too much but it fun
Lol, but can y’all add avengers tools to creative.🌟⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟"
The state board requires it on mobile	If we got it on mobile it would be more easy to look instead of going to a website to look and we can check how we are doing and see how mobile players can get better and if you do it we could see the most kills we have and try to bet it just overall plz and checking stats to mobile
Alright game	When I first got this game there was no issues. I even purchased the no ads. But when I switched to a new phone I lose most of my progress while playing. Please fix the game. Deleted. Let me know when bugs are fixed. Wasted money on no ads just to have my color disappear and game freezes. Like I said, didn’t have this problem when I first downloaded. And I’ve had it for a while.
Lags	The game great in general but for some mobile players the game is really laggy so I expect a little more stable gameplay.
A bit too much	TOO MUCH ADSSSSSS
Put 50 v 50 back in the game	I am so addicted to the game it is unreal but before when there was about 5 different team options was better. So I am suggesting that 50 v 50 should come back into the game or maybe food fight.
Compatability	Honestly I think fortnite should come available for iphone5s or Samsung galaxy tab a1-6
Stupid	Takes up to much storage
Fortnite	Amazing game
Great game but too many people using mouse and keyboard	Overall good game would give 5 but I’m giving 4 cause I always get killed by people using a mouse and keyboard please fix
Review for paper io 2	"I like this game but it’s quite hard to steer otherwise it’s great and wayyyyy better than the first one 
And I should know I’m a kid!"
Too many adverts	Give it a miss,only after you’re money
Fortnite	This game is so amazing love it u can build to protect your self u can get great skins to make your player look really awesome and they are cool dances that u can do
FORTNITE	I just love Fortnite but what I wish is the infinity gauntlet will come back but it never will can you please just add it back please
Mommy	Is good
COOL	I LOVE IT!
I love the game but...	I’ve been playing Fortnite since September of 2017 and I’m not sure when I started playing mobile. The updates used to be right on time, but now I have to wait the entire day just for a content update. Please consider releasing updates on mobile a little bit earlier!
Fortnight login after update	I always play fortnight but after it updates I need to make  a new account can you fix this
If I have a iOS account can I put that account on Xbox one	I was wondering I have a good iOS account and I am getting a Xbox one can I put my iOS account on to the Xbox one
Too hard	This game is impossible to win for any casual gamer. Way too many buttons for a mobile game. Not fun at all.
FORTNITE IS DA BEST	"To Epic Games 
I am writing to you to say that Fortnite is a very good game but I think it still can be improved if you still have the gliders because some people are still annoyed because they have to find them is chests also I love the game so muck and there should bring Light Machine Gun but I love the game and I love playing it"
Fun... but	It’s fun and all but it’s really difficult on everything cost a lot of money and I get made fun of when I was a default and I love the battle pass but it keeps costing money every time so that’s why I choose Minecraft it’s much better you should try it sometime
Fix your game	My game keeps on crashing every time i land
Hgdgvfhvdyjfd	I like it
FORTNITE review!!	This game is fun and let’s you play with friends or family. In my opinion FORTNITE is the best battle royals game on iOS, pc, and on any other device.
Pretty...ok...I guess.	I mostly play for the vehicle tricks.
I LOVE THIS GAME!!	Ever since season 4 came out I stared playing non-stop .I love the quality and how good the game comes out . There just one thing that I personally don’t like it is how there are updates every week and I have to update the game so manny times :/ . But other than that it is an amazing game . It’s a 10/10 .
Addicting and Trash	Fortnite might be popular, but seriously guys, lots of people download this game when they are under 12. It just encourages fighting and guns. Also, people are so addicted to this game, and it drives me crazy! I downloaded this game because everyone says it’s the game of the century, but it’s not. That’s why I give it 0 out of 5 stars. I don’t understand the controls, and my game glitches so much!  Once,  I got a really good gun, and the game glitched so that it disappeared a few minutes after. FIX THE GLITCHES!!! Also, at some schools, this game is banned, and kids are getting in trouble for playing this game. And I blame it all on fortnite. Never play this game.
The updates... the updates...	Honestly I love this game but for real it updates like every other day it’s so annoying. If u could fix it that would be fantastic. Otherwise it’s great, though.
Fortnite	I like this game and it’s awesome who ever made this game I wish I could give one thousand dollars to
So Fun	This game is so fun but it takes forever to load
Great game!	Helix jump is so fun. All my friends play it and I wondered why it was so popular. The only thing I could complain about is the amount of adds. I get that they need ads for money but there are A LOT of them. There’s one after every other game and one in the corner at all times. I sometimes accidentally tap on the add in the corner and it’s annoying but otherwise this is a great game!
Why I don’t like fortnight	I don’t like fortnight because you can’t download it on all electronic devices and I was really looking forward to playing and seeing if it really all that like people say it is because everyone at my school is always talking about how good it is but I can’t download it because I have a iPhone 6 but if I was the owner of fortnight I would make it so that no matter what kind of electronic device you have you can still download it
Fortnite stole me v bucks	It Stole my v bucks when I had 1000 v bucks take down your app epic games I have done a week of chores for 10$ Worth of v bucks I hate epic games if I had the chance I would sue them
😍🥰😘🥰😍😍😍😍🌈💝💗💖💕💞💓💘❤️	I absolutely love love love this game it is super fun to play and of course win! I do not have any special remarks to make this game better! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love your games	I love your games
Great game	The game runs great, but if you don’t have a great WiFi signal it makes you lag. The updates are also not showing up on the AppStore when it says they should. The game does crash from time to time and then you glitch off the game and you don’t get to carry on with the match. 👍👍
Why!!!!!	Why it can’t work on iPhone 5s
The Ads	"The game is great, but then you have the ads. Each ad is about one minute long and you have to watch one every time you die, want to earn an extra life, or even opening the game sometimes. Each ad is also repetitive. The game is fun, but the ads ruin it for me. The game is not worth $2 just to remove the ads, nor is it worth $2 at all for any aspect of it.

I’m fine with ads at times, but when it’s 1 minute ads without a skip button every time you open the app, die, or even just tap something, you kill the game. Nobody likes ads, but nobody will buy a package for $2 to remove ads when they can easily get a similar game for free without any ads at all. Placing a ton of ads doesn’t encourage purchasing an ad free version of the app, it encourages greed and for customers to delete the app."
Update	I can’t update the game the atualization doesn’t appears to my App Store.
Too long to load	I swear I have to update it everyday and it takes about 10 minutes just to update and than another 5 minuets to load than it takes forever to get you into a game. I wish it was faster and less updates their very annoying.
I can’t figure out how i logged in	So there is like the websites to reset your email and all that but i forgot how i logged in and i down money on this game and i would like to log in on a different device
Best game ever	This is the best game ever, u can get up to many levels u can go against friends and families to see who gets the highest and Maybe  the winner can receive a great treat
What the hell	Omg I crash every game what is wrong with your game. I swear you guys wouldn’t even read this message cause u guys don’t care about us. man What the hell.
Why	I liked it more on Nintendo switch and then you put it on mobile like really Epic Games
Love it but i do have a concern	Love the game but I’m best on ps4 the concern is why V-bucks purchased on one system can’t be redeemed on others ?
Best Game EVER!!	This game is amazing, hello there is one thing I don’t like about the weekly update they should make an update every season and me or at least two times in a season...
Best game ever	You are the best epic games
Overall Fortnite Is A Good Game	Don’t get me wrong fortnite is an actual real fun way I entertain myself but two things that bug me are when I play duos with one of my friend or even squads right before I glide it logs me out of the app and makes me restart everything. The second thing that bugs me is when I am in the middle of a battle it always freezes and makes the other person get the kill but not only in matches does it freeze or glitch but also when i am walking around or pickaxing it takes me back where I was 5 seconds ago. I really hope Epic Games can fix these glitches.
Way to laggy	Out of all the fortnites from Xbox to Pc, this one is laggiest. If you try to switch a gun and turn around, It takes about 8 seconds, enough to get pumped. Fortnite it a great game overall but this is laggy as heck.
Fix the Glitch!!!!	I have been playing this game for a while and for the past week or so I have this glitch where I reach my highest score and the little ball just keeps on going down and never stops. I love the game so much but will stop playing but if this continues I don’t know what to do. Please try and fix it.
Savage D7K	I don’t like season 9
aids	I have contracted HIV from these pc sweats in arena
Fortnite pls help	Fortnite pls bring blue pumb and other all pumps back I am neaver gonna play fortnite
ADS	I can’t play this game, every two seconds, here’s an add, and another one, JUST STIP WITH THE ADDS!
Improvement	PLEASE READ EMPLOYEES, this game is so much fun and enjoyable to play especially with your friends or just random people. Although, people are just getting too good at this game. I’m not complaining because i know that this is a competitive game, but it’s so hard to get solo wins. When I wanna play with my friends they’re never online so, I do squads fill but i match up with terrible people. In squads fill you should match people up the same competitive range and stuff. Also, the HUGE update today on April 25 of 2019 is not letting me update my game. I’ve been waiting for almost 3 hours and it’s still telling me to “OPEN” the app when I need to update it. Please fix this!
Women at Strong	🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰👩🏻👧🏻💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Best game ever is definitely the case	Fortnite mobile is the best phone game you can ever play. If anyone disagrees with that, they need some help because fortnite is the best game ever I mean it is sooo fun you just wanna play all day all night!!!
Best game ever but one thing	I love this game but it has to many Loading screens and the skins should be free other than that I love this game it is so fun!!!!!!!😃😄
Great game needs to be on more devices	Please epic let all apple users or any phone users play Fortnite I got an iPhone so I can play it on my phone but turns out it doesn’t work with this version so please do that but it is a great game
Helix Jump	Is very good and a lot of hard levels
Game is trash so are you dude	Season nine is poop just like you like I said bring back season 3 or I will poop on you, but I guess that doesn’t make a difference because you are already poop
Help my MIC	First add me MorenoAna12 okay so my friend did not get season 5 battle pass and needs drift PUT DRIFT IN THE SHOP THIS GAME IS DOPE GET IT but I also cannot use the mic something is wrong so watch out and it is on Mobil so anyway this is awesome.
Accessible	Wish it was compatible with my phone
Fortnite is the best	"Fun fun fortnite
Oreo
Rocky game
The best
Nice game
Incredible
The best
Ever and ever the best"
Ikonik	My brother wanted the ikonik skin back for free for computer and emote because my parents hate him and kicked him out the house so I let him in my house and play fortnite everyday and he wanted the ikonik skin forever but he had no phone
Helix jump	Funnest strategy not needed game that I have ever played.👍🏻
This game is great	This game is awesome and is really fun with friends and family I really have a good time and there might be little mistakes but epic will fix it fast as they can and will put stuff in the game what the people want you don’t have to spend money but I do because I love skins.
Last day on earth is the best	Please come up with games like this  in the future I just love it so so much.Its the reason why I get up off bed to go get my phone start playing the best games ever created
ASWESOME!!!!!	Thanks for letting iPhone 6s play Fortnite whooo woo
Fortnite look into this stability issue	Can I get some compensation for this game it’s literally pissing me off I keep freezing due to some issues cuz of your game and I’m hearing other people are getting v bucks and I never got nun
Helxi jump	I love helix jump
This company takes your money and lies	Do not trust this company with your money. They will never respond to your emails after they have taken your money.
GAME MODES PPLLZZ	Ok, I’m a huge fan about all your games!!! (Especially Hole.io.) But the only thing I’m gonna talk about is game modes. I love them!!! I hope you do solo battle royal and friends. I just don’t like the simple old one where it’s just get %100.00. So yeah still love your game but just think about it.
Bug	This new update made my game crash five times in 4 minutes
Fortnite	Good game and I’m enjoying myself
Bugs	"Ok imagine your in a top 20 scenario you get a air drop and a chug chug and boom bow with slurp and a campfire falls off and you have 20 hp this would be clutch then all of a sudden you crash And you get mad and quit the game 
Well that’s me CAN YOU FIX THE DANG SERVERS MY WIFI IS GOOD I HAVE LOTS OF STORAGE AND SUCH AND YET WHEN I PLAY THIS GAME I LAG OUT IN THE BEGINNING OR TOP 50 And 20"
Love this game but.....	This is an awesome game, the best game I have ever played it’s Fortnite Battle Royal. But I will like to said that why Fortnite it’s not compatible with iphone 6, a lot of people wants to use this amazing game but some of them can’t just cause of this. I want to you epic please, pleeeaaseee habilitate Fortnite for iphones 6 to the X. If theirs something wrong with habilitating this game for iPhones 6, please work it fast. Thanks for you creation Epic. Best game on top baby;).
Issues	I hate how it doesn’t work for iPhone6 why is that? It should work for all apple devices
I LOVE IT but something went wrong	So I was just playing, and I had to go to dinner. So I turn off my phone. And no joke my score was at like 100,000 something. I went on the game today, and it was the same score from before I turned it off. That should not happen. Please fix this if you can. Other than that I LOVE IT!!
Great game	Fortnite is a great game and can be loads of fun. It is a little hard to build on mobile and can be laggy, though. It adds new ltms frequently, making it more fun. The skins are great too. The game can lag a lot and may crash sometimes, which can be frustrating. Besides adding new ltms Epic Games is running out of ideas for new weapons, skins, etc. There are some weapons in the game that are utter trash though. Like the burst smg and silenced pistol. A lot of people were mad when they vaulted the pump, and I was too. It has gotten a bit boring over the months. It was way more fun in season 4 than now in season 9.
Best game out there	Fortnite is my favorite game of all time I think you should all play this game my brother JAGASTER AKA WhyTry_Redo he is super good at the game so plz go check his YouTube channel WhyTry_Redo he is on a clan called WhyTry also go check WhyTry_Hoax,WhyTry_Nova good players.
Needs work	So I’ve been playing since season 3 and it was great but one thing is that on mobile I can’t play save the world and that’s the only reason I downloaded it to play save the world
Fortnite mobile=good game	Good game ita good game fax that’s it
Update	There’s updates every week example last day new update now another one 🤬
Love this game	This game is awesome I love it so much I already have half the skins!<3
BEST GAME EVER	"HAVE YOU HEARD⁉️
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER‼️"
Buggy ;(	Love this game but its bugging out after last update. My territory goes invisible, and sometimes after getting high percentage >60 all my territory disappears but .17%, please fix.
Let me play	Why doesn’t it support on iPhone 5s it ain’t fair that the SE gets to play
Just why	This game gets worse every update is rather watch Mickey Mouse
Fortnite	Good graphics good guns building and more updates every day
Dead	"Yo this game is dead , a few months ago I played this and thought it was good but not anymore.It is a waste of ur time there r to much sweats in the game and people just waste time on the couch playing!Look at frikin Ninja he spends more than 13 hours playing it. 

                                                     
                                         It is DEAD!!,"
Fun for you but not for me	I love Fortnite I but my game keeps getting lagger and lagger each update.I would have put a five or four star but at this point I crash every game.So that could lead to me losing the progress I made in a match or if I’m about to win I crash like when I’m in the top 5 I crash.
Amazing	I only got this game today and it is awesome.Best game yet ❤️.     I think there should be no changes.I love it
BRING BACK THE GIDDUED MISSLE.	I WILL REGRET THIS BRING BACK ALL THE VAULTED WEAPONS
I hate this	I hate this bull
Do not download	This game is simply trash.All players r toxic extremely unfair matchmaking because on mobile i always play against pc and console(whose aim assist is no skill)
Terrible	Trash
Paper. Io	I’m just really confused. Because when I had a really big circle, some player came and touched it then the game was over. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Brilliant though	Best game ever ! I am a fortnite player myself, it is very quick. The only problem is that it takes up quite a lot of space. By the way my account name is Hugodertsy please could you PLEASE add one skin to my account.
Epic Games Better fix this!!!!!!!!	Dear Epic, I need to know why I keep getting kicked out of a match when I know I have good internet connection please fix this I’m tired of getting kicked out and losing so much xp please fix this error thank you.
Please fix this crash bug	I Like the Game and ITS amazing but the only problem I have it crashes my game and it quits me from the game. Please fix this bug.
Replay mode	There should be replay mode I Fortnite mobile because I can make epic videos and I want to something back can you play add replay mode.
100% get this game😍	This game has fun modes and good skins,good seasons epic keep up the good work
The best fighting game you can get	You will have the best time playing this game.you can play with friends or on your own 😀😍
It’s good but bring back food fight	I looooooooooooooove it and all but can you bring back food fight
Fortnite	Best mobile and pc game for me and I love the game and iam hoping the new update is a start to season 9 although it’s a long time away
please make these changes	Ok. So I’m on a giant floating school bus. Not weird at all. This just everyday in Fortnite. BUUUUUUT Fortnite could be better, like customizations for the battle bus, skin trading, old battle pass skins in the shop, and private competitions. and a deluxe battle pass. Yes a THIRD battle pass. And if you do this, Fortnite will become SO much more popular. Like in my school people don’t really play Fortnite that much and after this possible update a lot more people in my school will play AND with this, you will have more power to fight back against even MORE popular games ( apex legends, etc.) AND more popularity means more power to fight even NEWER games so... FORTNITE BECOMES THE BEST GAME OF THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where is my update ??????	Hello
My skins have gone	Where are all my skins
Nice	This app is amazing and so cool
:(	It’s a hard game everybody’s good.Once you you get better it’s more and more difficult.I recommend you play other games.They also add items that make no sense being there like balloons and boom boxes.DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IT GETS BORING,TIRING, AND GETS YOU ADDICTED.Please sub to my YouTube at DEX_Saiyan thx. :(
Yes she is	Hehehejdnd Fortnight is the best game ever made and nobody can tell me Daddy’s
Fortnite	"When ever there is an update, I have to press the update button 20 times before it actually updates 

Love the game though"
Really	You know what very bad game you know why it Freezes every time I play and I move to the right left and it freezes and It makes me die that I’m sick and tired of this game
A game that’s better than pubg	This is the best game ever!!! it’s better than pubg, it’s better than overwatch, it’s better than cod. It’s the best game ever!!! Play with me:Nascarracer4795
Good game! Just one thing is annoying.	I love the game it’s super fun and kinda challenging so I think it’s a lot of fun! But one thing that’s annoying me is that you can eliminate yourself. It annoys me a lot. So please change that. But apart from that it’s super fun and I think you should get the game!
Best game ever!! But need some changes	"Fortnite is a great game but on mobile not that great. Fortnite need to change the lag and sometimes the graphics lags and sometime I can’t ever shoot the fire button!!
But fortnite is still the best game ever (in my opinion). So plz fortnite could u plz change that lag!!"
Plane bag	There is a bug that I like the invisible plane but why did you fix it?? FORTNITE is GOOD AND AND I LIKE THE UPDATE YOU CAN SOM HOW OPEN EGGS FIX IT
Bots	Bots target you and behave unnaturally.
Fortnite	Fortnite is the best game in the world
The best!!! 💜	Keep doing what y'all are doing.
Good game	It's fun but you can vault the pump like that? And the new styles for drift should be free for people who already have drift. You gave free new styles to renegade raider and skull trooper but make everyone pay for drifts new styles. And I think it's because footnotes dead and you want more money tbh.
Amazing game	I love how the patched all the glitches and how the game is so fun you gave 3 very fun game modes I love this game so much thanks for making it free.
It was ok in season 8	It was pretty bad
Fun game	It’s a fun game
Gang	Gang
Horrible	So I feel like how it constantly takes 1 hour to load or it says needs to be installed again every day or 2 and so I feel like this game is for fake gamers real gamers would be playing Minecraft so bye Fortnite
Awesome	It’s a awesome game I really cannot stop playing
Fortnite	Why don’t you let iPhone 6 play that what I don’t like please fix that i phone 6 should be able to play fortnite fix please
Eh	It’s fun and addicting, but takes incredibly long just to accomplish anything significant such as opening new areas of the map or building vehicles etc. kind of starts to get too repetitive with little reward. I wish the game would reward you with more so the tasks progress.
Fun game! But...	Very fun game!!! Very addictive... I problem, it glitches a LOT.😑 But other than that it’s 💯% perfect😁
TO MANY ADS!!!!!	I get killed once I already have an ad waiting for me every single game I thought the second Paper.io will have less ads bot no I was wrong
Fix creative mode and add more huds	I like creative mode but the only problem is that there’s a glitch where you enter your island and leave and you want to load another island you have to leave the match. And also I want you guys to add different huds like in clash of clans with the different bases I want that since I’m used to different controls and I’m tired of changing them every round I feel like using this controls
Helix Jump	Lags and glitches a lot when I’m playing and I always die
Good game, terrible tech support and customer service	Spent months on this working up my base for it to suddenly disappear because they had a server issue. They couldn’t restore my progress so offered me one small chest to compensate me (which I’d previously purchased!). Useless customer service, refusing to look after customers who have used the game for months. It’s a good game but hope nothing goes wrong otherwise you’re stuffed!
crazy	what a game
Food fight	Food fight was my favorite game mode can you bring it back but can you do snowman and Santa for the Christmas spirit 🎄i would play Fortnite A LOT more -THANK U❤️
Pretty Good	All in all the game itself is fantastic, but there are several issues on mobile. The reload button, building, and shooting are all wacky but the gameplay on mobile is not too bad for what it is. Thanks Epic Games
Yaaaasss	Addictive. High score is 289,976
You messed up	I can log into my game!!! Also why did you make it so laggy you better take advice from fans cuz fortnite is so trash right now! You better take action before the game dies
Amazing game but way too glitchy	Can’t play the game normally because you always die on some glitch (running the latest os and update), also the game isn’t consistent on when a kill happens and sometimes your entire color area disappears completely, etc. needs an update
Great game but...	I just recently got this game and I LOVE it!!!! The only thing is every time I interact with a raider or another player the game closes... so right when I kill another player and I go to reap my just rewards... the game closes and I find myself staring at my home screen... it’s infuriating! So now I have to run away from any all threats that aren’t just zombies in the game... please help! I will gladly raise my rating to five stars once this gets fixed!!!!
Fortnite is The best	Fortnite can you make a gun called Comp submachine gun
Loading...	This is a great game, no doubt, but takes SOoooOoooOooOoOOOooo long to load.
So many bugs and lags in it and it always freezes and crashes	I am sick an tired trying to play fortnite with my friends when my game always freezes and crashes
Best game.	Hi! I play this game on Nintendo switch and my name is Sniperdiapergirl. I don’t see a review button on the switch, so I came here to tell you this is the best game and please make a v bucks pack that is 500 v buck and make it 2.99, please. LOVE THE GAME
Fortnite	This game is really epic because I all ways get top 10 in solo duos and squads thank you EPIC so muck for releasing this game
Meh	It’s ok but it keeps lagging me out
Spoilt by the barrage of advertising 😡	Sick to death of being spammed by adverts constantly.  I'd happily pay for an ad free version.
Fortnite IS THE BEST	IT JUST IS EPIC
TO MANY ADS	There are so many ads in this game, you get an ad each time you die.  The same ads spamming over and over again. Has great potential to be a good game but the ads ruin it. AND it is VERY glitchy.
Perfection	I’m 14 year old teen and this game is my favourite of its type. IT IS GOOD ( must try ) .
Updates	I hate it when a new update comes out and sometimes you have to wait to update it please fix this problem because sometimes I can’t play because of this stupid update problem please change 😔
Grate but...	I need a favor can you make it to we’re people can’t make their name unkind or not kid frendly thank you 😊
I Love this	I play Fortnite on Xbox and I love it on this to epic games has done such a good job on Fortnite it’s come so far and I think it’s the no doubt best game on the free games ❤️❤️❤️❤️😃😃😃
I love Fortnite	I love this game but maybe stop with all the new update and things because I have to update it all the time but I LOVE this game so much✨🔆🖤💛✨✨
It used to be good	It used to be good but now with all the weird updates it makes playing really annoying. Also the map thing that shows were u are- I’m only on level 520 and it takes FOREVER for the map to go all the way down. The new updates mean you can’t have double power ups. You can also go through the walls really easily. And I have already unlocked 10 skins but the skin which says u get after unlocking 10 is still locked!! Please fix allll these things and then I will give 5 stars 😂👍 it is still sorta fun tho
Fortnite	Best thing that happened to this world
Review	This game is good but it would help if I didn’t have to sit there waiting for it to load for about 5 hours and then still not even load
I like this game a lot I have it on ps4 it’s cool I play fortnite on molbile It’s cool	I hate players who don’t like I love this so mutch
Lag	To much lagging on mobile needs to be fixed it’s not fair game play when we lag and they don’t even lost matches due to this so please resolve this matter the game just start to annoy ya when it does this
EPIC GAMES please read this	Fortnite is very fun I love it but the thing that is not fair is on mobile you can’t buy save the world 🌎 I want to play it but since I’m on mobile I can’t please add Fortnite save the world on mobile I would appreciate it
Controller support	Hey great game been playing since mid season 2. I just wanna know when will ps4 controllers be able to connect?
New maps	Diferint maps
Game is fun	This game is really fun and addicting but I tried purchasing a few packs and then got an error message... I paid but received nothing?
Ads...	It’s a great game, but there’s a lot of ads...
LDOE	GREAT GAME ...... Very difficult to obtain weapons ...
Please put it on iPhone 6	Y’all need to put it on iPhone 6
Always something to do	You can always play creative or playground if you constantly rage playing solos duos and squads but when ever a new LTM is out within the game you can always have fun with that also a good factor is playing with your friends
Why does it FREEZE SO MUCH	The game is awesome but why does it freeze up so much bro. Please fix this or deleting this game of my phone.
I’m quiting	Th reason why I’m quiting is I bough a dumb skin with 1500 vbucks and I was saving up for beef boss and I’m bad at the game and I don’t get the point of me playing and not getting a win half of my friends stoped playing I bough over 6 skins I didn’t want.
Drum gun	Bring the drum gun back!!!!!!!!
Please fix the sos	Can you add double pumping back please I never have used it before and I got and sos on my controller
Please make fortnite for other phones	Please make it for i phone 6 and some other phones
This games trash	This games trash , unvault the pump and take out the drum gun and do something about sweats and stop trying to protect the noobs
Why?	"Can you give mobile and the switch there own pools 
I keep getting killed by them and mobile and switch are 2 completely different sets"
More	Poop
Omg	FIX YOUR FREAKING GAME
So awesome	I love this game!!! It is soo fun, once you get the hang of it!! I like how it challenges you. The one thing I don’t like though is how there is a lot of adds.
FALSE ADVERTISING	The ad for this game showed that at level seven the colors were neon and it looked pretty cool so I thought 'Oh! This game looks cool! I'm going to get it!' So then I went to go get it. I've had it for a couple of days and it's definitely addictive, but I got to level 100 and I still haven't seen the colors that made me get the game!
Good	I like it but when I use the “walk” button it never works heh
غلوي	حلوه و كيوت
Dookey	Ninja is a new phone it’s a new phone and a new iPhone and I love it I love the new update and it I would like more new and more games to add new levels and new play Fortnite .
Really glitchy on mobile	I love fortnite but on mobile it ways lags and Evan at full WiFi connection. If you do get the game don’t get on your phone or iPad. If you do you will regret it.
Put 60fps in the game	Hi if your reading this epic games pleese put 60fps because it will be a lot better than 30fps
Good game!	So, this game is really, really good! But, I think this needs to be sorted: my cousin wants to gift me a skin now since gifting is back, but he can’t since 2FA isn’t enabled, and I’ve tried to tell him how to do it, but it keeps saying he can’t do it. Just get rid of 2FA for gifting, please!!
Best game play fortnight	Fortnight is the best not for young people
Fav game But.....	I love this game it’s so fun But the glitches the lag the FPS the ping terrible it used to be fun until season 7 then it was to much polar peak was awful I always die of fall damage unless if I get balloons then what does Fortnite do they vault pump shotgun ballons cligner dynamite dual pistols so many others destroy retail and tilted then they add neo tilted and mega mall thinking everything’s OK but it’s not it’s worse Fortnite I will give you advice stop updating quit Fortnite and make a new game a fresh start I don’t mean to be rude but somebody has tell you and it’s me I love now it’s OK but here’s your chance to have more money and it’s the easiest way stop make a new game maybe change the genre i don’t really care. Overall good work on your game good luck!
Best game ever	It’s amazing even on mobile it’s great
Hi world	I love this game honestly, but I’m a switch player. I am just writing a review on mobile don’t ask why. Updates are awesome, with new items, cosmetics, battle passes, or locations. so I love cranking 90s on people and triple ramping so yah I hope fortnite wont die cause I’m writing this in season 9
I love it	Now helix jump is a good game because u don’t have to use WiFi and when u are bored you can play and also it can be very entertaining WHO EVER MADE THIS APP IS A SUPER STAR.
Great game, needs improvements.	This game is my favorite phone game. One thing, every time I die, I go back to get my stuff and the game crashes so I have to do it again. Also, the game will randomly crash.

Add ipad air for mobile	Plz add ipad air not air 2 the original one on mobile
M	This game is very fun but when I pressed second chance after I died I watched the video and it took me straight back to the start of the level!
Ads!	"There are soooo many ads! I was honestly okay with watching them after a couple rounds or whatever. Now there are so many that it makes the game and my phone lag to the point I end up dying regardless. So there’s that....

Update: downloaded it again several months later and the same problem is still occurring."
Every devise	Epic pls make Fortnite on every devise
Haib9211	Fortnite
By:lonemuffin08	Very fun game and great graphics but there are some mean people but there are mostly nice people and you have to be very smart to win the game so that is why this game is so good plus it is free.
Plane	Every time I exit the plane my app closes fix this
🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌😱	I always love to play this game on spare time or whenever I have free time. It’s so much fun to get 1st place every time I play ( I really do get 1st every time) keep up the good work!!
I hate Fortnite	I hate Fortnite it is the worst game I have ever played And that is why I give you one star

Great app	Great game
Magydx	This is so good it’s amazing
It good but I have some questions	Can you make a free battle pass for season nine. How do you change your name? Also it will be cool if you let us get a free skin every Friday but change what kind of skin it is each Friday like first item shop skin then tier skin then a challenge skin.
Fortnite	"I honestly love fortnite I play on PS4 and mobile I wish I got free battle bus now I’m very sad at myself. 

Ps.love epic bye"

Epic games are the best	You are the best but I have no v bucks can you give me 6896589886
AWESOME GAME	Fortnite is a awesome game free to play I have so much fun the only problem is it uses my battery way to fast but overall awesome
Fortnite	Fortnite is awesome the best game ever but I do need some help playing and getting victory royals but I do not like that it locked my account forever.
I can't use it on my iPod touch！	It’s said that I can use it on my iPod touch.But when I play it, it’s said that  should have 2GB memory to run!
Please	Hey epic games is it cool if you can make an update so that way iPhone 6 an 6pluses can play fortnite please hey ios 12 6plus at least because a lot of kids only have an 6 or 6plus to use plus 6 plus can buy more gigabytes come on plz. You know what epic don’t you see thousands of people have a iPhone 6plus that would kill for fortnite that will charge for a skin infact my big brother almost spent 300 dollars on fortnite skins imagine how much all these people with a iPhone 6plus would.
It takes too long to load	Fortnight is a good game but it takes too long to load
Best gun game	This is the best shooting and gun game ever released u can buy skins with v bucks which is the in game money but u need to buy v bucks with real money
This game is trash!!!!!!!!!	This game is trash because it does not support iPhone 6s+🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Its good but can someone please help me get a victory royal	I am 👌🤔😐😑
Bxhdhdhdh	Awesome
Gg	Good game yayyyyy kisses and rainbows🙄 JP its a good game
Amazing but to many adds	Helix jump is an amazing game but there are so many adds. Every time you die or pass a level there’s and add and you do that every second of the game. The game is all about trying to pass the level so instead of getting an add you should add a money thing or something to you can buy more things to buy.
Broken	This game was great until my setting started to go missing like I edited my hud and one of the inventory slots are gone and the joystick just disappeared I tried to fix by putting toggle to sprint but it’s still gone I can move and stuff but I can’t auto run. So if you’re reading this please fix. Thx
😬	I think it is an ok game
Review	This app is great you can choose from many balls and splashes it is so fun and creative
Best game ever	I love this game is so fun nonstop fun 😀😀

Save the world all platforms	You should have save the world an all platforms
Thank you for the great game	I love fortnite. I’ve been playing it since it came out. I just wanted to say thanks to epic and everyone who works there.
Too many updates	I don’t play this game a lot anymore for one reason. Too many updates. I swear every time I get on every once in a while there’s an update and it takes forever. To the point where I’m going to delete fortnite. Some of the updates are also just a waste of your time it’s like u have to update it to get s new mode or something and then update it again to get rid of it. Like really ?
